![I'm a passionate nerd!](@assets/images/about_passionate_nerd.webp)

Thanks for stopping by my digital cottage! By day I'm a software development manager for USAFacts. 

By night I'm a java overlord (of the coffee persuasion), aspiring runner, spider killer for my wife, and silly daddy to my twin daughters. 

Here, you'll find a bit of coding, a few thoughts on life, and random things I come across.
