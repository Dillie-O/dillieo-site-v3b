[Died: Dallas Willard, 'Divine Conspiracy' Author and Philosopher](http://blog.christianitytoday.com/ctliveblog/archives/2013/05/died-dallas-willard-divine-conspiracy-author.html).

> According to Gary Moon, executive director of the Dallas Willard Center at Westmont College, Willard [died](http://dallaswillardcenter.com/) early Wednesday morning, but "awakened to a full experience of the reality of the Kingdom of the Heavens he described so beautifully. Fittingly, his last two words were, "'Thank you.'"

Dallas' books inspired me greatly and it is sad to see him go. But given where he is now I think the quote above expresses it best.
