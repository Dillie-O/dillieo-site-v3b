![2012 Year in Review](@assets/images/posts/2012-12-2012yearinreview.jpg)

So here we are, the end of another year and while I don't blog for a living, I try to be serious enough about it that stats matter. Plus it's fascinating to see how the year pans out in my blog. Here's some interesting info for a year in review.

<!--more-->

The busiest day I had this year was 706 visitors, mainly to visit my post about [The Thankful Tree](/the-thankful-tree). It's an older post, but having a quick idea on how to make one I think helps get people interested in it. That and I believe there is a band or something called the Thankful Tree as well. 8^D

That said, here are the top five posts based on views I had this year. Interestingly enough most of them were the same as before, with one new entry to the mix:

### 5 [Soup to Nuts: Creating a Timeout Notifier in ASP.Net using AJAX Toolkit or jQuery](/soup-to-nuts-creating-a-timeout-notifier-in-asp-net-using-ajax-toolkit-or-jquery)

With more and more jQuery development going on, this one is on the rise.

### 4 [How to Sort/Find Custom Objects in a List with VB.Net](/how-to-sortfind-custom-objects-in-a-list-with-vb-net)

Creating your own objects is quite helpful, especially if you can add them to a list collection and be able to sort it. I've "dog fooded" this one myself a couple of times this year.

### 3 [Windows Server 2003 64bit, IIS 6 32bit, ASP.Net 4 Framework, and Targeting](/windows-server-2003-64bit-iis-6-32bit-asp-net-4-framework-and-targeting)

This one is still a hat tip to my buddy [Ben](http://redtrails.com/). It turns out people are still having issues with this one.

### 2 [Quick Tip: How to use OnClick and OnClientClick events to Prevent Double Clicking on your ASP.Net Buttons](/quick-tip-how-to-use-onclick-and-onclientclick-events-to-prevent-double-clicking-on-your-asp-net-buttons)

I wrote this one back in July after discovering a bug we were having with users double clicking submission buttons and causing duplicate entries in the database. I've had to use this one a couple of times and it seems to be a common problem for folks

...and still the #1 post for a couple of years running now is

### [How to swap faces using Windows Live Photo Gallery](/how-to-swap-faces-using-windows-live-photo-gallery)

I was always baffled at how cool this trick was but hard to find. I guess other folks were having the same issues too. I still get comments and questions about it.

So thank you, loyal readers, for another year of blogging. I hope to be more frequent in MMXIII with blogging and plan to keep it diverse. I might even look into merging my photo and quote blog in, to create a kind of "full pictures" of my interests.

Is there anything you've been curious for me to blog about? I'd love to hear it! Take care and keep reading!
