Considering I had a small mining rig going, and even made a recommendation, about this service, I felt it important to send out a quick note.

There have been reports that the HashOcean service is a big scam and has cut and run with their funds over the weekend. As of this morning I haven't been able to login myself, and with my configuration set to not auto-payout, it's hard to know for sure. Plenty of rumors are fast and furious, and a few "official" sources are saying it is just a hack, but time will tell.

For the moment, I can't recommend HashOcean until I know for sure, and you should hold off too.
