Peace is a lie; there is only passion.  
Through passion, I gain strength.  
Through strength, I gain power.  
Through power, I gain victory.  
Through victory, my chains are broken.  
The Force shall free me.  
_[- The Sith Code](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Sith_code)_

There is no emotion, there is peace.  
There is no ignorance, there is knowledge.  
There is no passion, there is serenity.  
There is no chaos, there is harmony.  
There is no death, there is the Force.  
_[- The Jedi Code](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Jedi_Code)_

Passion without Reason is anarchy. Reason without Passion is stagnation. Neither is optimal.

Discuss.
