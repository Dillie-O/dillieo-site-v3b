Sometimes I wonder what is better, a really good song, or a really good parody of that song. Weird Al has been the king of parody since I was just a kid.

<!--more-->

He truly amazes me with how he stays on top of pop culture and music and makes hilarious parodies of things. He also has a knack for playing the accordion extremely well and writing his own songs. While there are TONS of parodies in his library, this one is still one of my all time favorites. It's a parody of two Red Hot Chili Pepper songs (_Under the Bridge_ and _Give it Away_), but done with a Flintstones theme in mind.

Get your Al on and enjoy!
