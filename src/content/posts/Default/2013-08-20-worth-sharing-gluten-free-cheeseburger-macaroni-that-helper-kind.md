I've been working on my own "Daddy's Cookbook" for a little while now. I have pancakes, BBQ sauce, chicken nuggets, and other things that everybody in the family enjoys _(7 year olds can be quite picky at times)_. Having a good cheeseburger macaroni (or "helper" if you prefer) is a great recipe I've been wanting to add. The box stuff can get rather expensive at times and have you seen all the weird stuff they've put in it?! After much tweaking and tasting, I've finally found a recipe everybody likes.

_Note: This recipe has been modified from [Lynn's Kitchen Adventures](http://www.lynnskitchenadventures.com/2013/01/homemade-cheeseburger-helper.html) recipe._

Here are the ingredients:

- 1 lb. ground turkey _(you can use ground beef if you'd like)_
- 1 cup chicken stock _(vegetable stock or even water works in a pinch)_
- 2 cups rice milk _(regular milk works well too)_
- 1 cup "southwestern" salsa _(the kind with corn, black beans, etc. in it)_
- 2 cups gluten free small shell noodles _(macaroni or bow tie works too)_
- 2 tbsp. dried onion flakes _(you can use powder, but the flakes are much better)_
- 1 cup sour cream
- 2 cups shredded cheese _("fiesta" type blends work best, but sharp is good too)_

Directions:

1. Brown the meat in a large skillet. Drain any excess juices if they are there.
2. Add stock, milk, salsa, and noodles to the skillet and bring to a boil.
3. Once boiling, reduce heat to low, cover, and cook for 15 minutes, or until the pasta is done and most of the liquid is absorbed.
4. Take off the heat and mix in the onion flakes, sour cream, and cheese.
5. Cover and let sit for another 5 to 10 minutes until the cheese is melted and blended together.

_Note: Make sure to check your salsa ingredients if you are working on making this gluten free. I've been quite happy with Walmart's brand of southwestern salsa lately and it is gluten free._

Serve and enjoy! I personally like a little more of a kick at times, so I'll mix in a bit of Cholula hot sauce in my bowl when I serve myself.
