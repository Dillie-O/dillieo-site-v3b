Wow -- another year is swiftly coming to an end and while the blog has been quiet this year, there is still time to stop and reflect. I'm thankful for a lot of things, but a few that trickle to the top of my mind would be...

## Margin

I've really been trying to live into having more [margin](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/344825e0-3fdc-4d56-8d0b-28ac8ef5349b) in my life and it has been something I'm extremely thankful for. Those morning coffees with Jen on Mondays and Fridays. Enjoying some reading and a sunrise when I arrive early to the office. Taking [a minute to breathe](https://oneminutetobreathe.com). These small things have added up to something big.

## Rituals

The family's winter [Angband](/gaming-done-right-angband/) challenge. The bottle of [Beaujolais Nouveau](https://www.wineclubgroup.com/beaujolais-nouveau-thanksgiving-dinner/) with Thanksgiving dinner. The Friday night pizza and a movie. It's these things that we lean into and look forward to week over week, or year over year, that can add some familiarity, stability, and fond memories in crazy times.

## Text Messaging

Yep, that good 'ol fashioned, no frills, text, images, and maybe an animated gif technology that has been the one way I've kept in touch with friends for nearly 30+ years, kept prayer chains going, and allowed me to chat with previous coworkers. Those conversations are priceless.

## Et Vous?

What are you thankful for this year? It's more important than ever to find even the small things in your life and name them as we approach the grey of winter and cold it brings. There's also plenty of evidence to show how a mindset of thankfulness does wonders. [I’d like to hear them!](/contact/)
