Ugh… I remember walking into a Walmart BEFORE HALLOWEEN and seeing Christmas trees up and decorations scattered throughout the store. It seems to happen earlier and earlier every year. I suspect soon we’ll mark the first day of school as the day you put your Christmas decorations up or something.

Don’t get me wrong, Christmas, and the entire advent weeks leading up to the day we celebrate Christ’s birth, is my favorite time for more. I affectionately say that Christmas lights are like Jell-O… there’s always room for more. I have two solid playlists now that will run for weeks during this season to keep my spirits high and my mind contemplative.

But let’s give Thanksgiving it’s due. It’s a time to take a step back, reflect on the abundance of blessings we have, both large and small. Enjoy your family, enjoy some food, and let it linger beyond that single day into a small “season” of it’s own until December. That’s all. Thanks for listening.
