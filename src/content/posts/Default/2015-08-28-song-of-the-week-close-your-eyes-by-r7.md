I've been a big fan of [R7](http://r7.net) (formerly Rubicon 7) for a while now. They do an amazing job with progressive house, techno, whatever you want to call it (I'm still rather dense in this area). They do a weekly show on [di.fm](http://di.fm/mainstage) that I try not to miss.

Anyway, they came out with a new single, called _Close Your Eyes_ and I really really like it! It's topping some of the charts, and they have a preview of it available online.
