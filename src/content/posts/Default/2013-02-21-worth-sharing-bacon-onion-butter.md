I discovered this little gem in my amazing [BBQ Sauces, Rubs, and Marinades](http://www.amazon.com/Barbecue-Bible-Sauces-Marinades-Butters/dp/0761119795/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1361199031&sr=8-1&keywords=barbeque+sauces%2C+rubs%2C+and+marinades) book yesterday and it was PHENOMINAL on our hamburgers. I just had to share, because it was simple too!

**Ingredients:**

- 8 Tablespoons (1 stick) of butter (let it sit out so it is room temperature)
- 3 Strips of lean bacon, cut into 1/4 inch slivers
- 1 Small onion diced
- 3 Tsp mustard (deli/brown mustard is preferred)
- 1 Pinch of Pepper

**Directions:**

1. Melt 1 tablespoon of butter in a hot skillet/pan.
2. Add bacon and cook until the fat just begins to render
3. Add onion and continue to cook until bacon is fully cooked and onion is golden brown
4. Once completed, take bacon and onion off heat and let it cool to room temperature.
5. In a bowl, whip together bacon, onion, mustard, pepper, and remaining butter until it is well mixed.

That's all there is to it! However, there are a few extra tricks:

If you're in a hurry (like I was last night) after cooking the bacon and onion, put it into a bowl and submerge the bowl into an ice bath (just don't get the bacon or onion wet). This will help it cool down quicker.

Once you've whipped everything together, place it onto a large piece of saran wrap. You can then roll and shape the butter into a log, which makes it easy to slice for later on. You can refrigerate it for 5 days or keep it for a couple of months in the freezer.

One of the best places to use this butter is on top of hamburgers. About 3 to 5 minutes before the burger is done, take good quarter inch slice off your roll and place it on top to melt.
