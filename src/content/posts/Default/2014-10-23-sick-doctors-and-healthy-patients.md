> Theology is full of theories and arguments expounding the miracles it works in each soul. We may be able to understand all these speculations, cogently discuss, write, teach, and instruct souls through them. But with only this in mind in relation to those whom that divine purpose exists, I suggest are like sick doctors trying to cure patients who are in perfect health.
