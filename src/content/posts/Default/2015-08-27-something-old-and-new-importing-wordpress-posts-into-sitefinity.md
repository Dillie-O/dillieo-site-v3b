I can't take too much credit for this, however, I made enough updates to the library that I felt it warranted a post.

If you're migrating your blog from WordPress into Sitefinity, I've taken an existing tool (major HT to [timw255](http://www.codemoar.com)) and modified it. I disabled some features with loading tags/metadata that caused errors. More importantly, I added the ability to have a "default" e-mail address, properly import the full image from the "thumbnail" images that WordPress typically uses, and cleaned up the summary field.

It's on Github, so as they say, if you don't like what I did, fork it and improve it yourself! 8^D

You can get the [WordPress to Sitefinity tool here](https://github.com/Dillie-O/WordPressToSitefinity).
