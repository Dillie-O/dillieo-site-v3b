I’m answering [my own question](http://talk.desk.pm/t/daily-post-7-10-2015/2023) today, but I’ve always been more parital to sunsets than sunrises. Admittedly I have an advantage of getting a great view of them from my deck (or roof) every day. For me, they allow me to reflect on what was done, and what can be done tomorrow. Sunsets remind me of another day accomplished, of uncountable things, little and big, that I am grateful for. They give me peace.
