Today is a big day in America since it's election day. Of equal importance around our house is that this is the first election that our girls are fully aware of and are interested in. It's been a great learning experience for them. We've been going over the process, have the live streams going with results as they come in, and have answered the questions they have. They're rather excited with the whole process.

However, given that this particular year has been far more about vilifying the other candidate than actually dealing with the issues that concern the nation most, it's been a rough year for the entire process.

Admittedly I'll be happy when this cycle is over. In another 4 years I hope we get back to the issues again.
