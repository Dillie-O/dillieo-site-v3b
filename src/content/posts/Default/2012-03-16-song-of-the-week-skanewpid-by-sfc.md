![SFC Phase III](@assets/images/posts/2012-03-sfc_piii.jpg)

In honor of my old friend Josh's birthday, I'm posting an old hip-hop favorite. Mainly because he pegged the title, intentionally or unintentionally, I don't know.

I'll go into the details about old school Christian Hip-Hop and how SFC was a staple of mine back in the day. For now, I'll just let you listen to a fun song, and see how many puns you can find.

Happy Birthday Josh!!!!!
