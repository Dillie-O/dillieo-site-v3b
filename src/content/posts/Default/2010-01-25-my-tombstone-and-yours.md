![Tombstone](/blog/image.axd?picture=2010%2f1%2fTombstone.png) A couple of weeks ago we were given a ?homework assignment? at our bible study to answer the question, ?What do you want written on your tombstone when you die??

This may seem like a rather morbid question, but it also a rather interesting one as well. My youth pastor often referred to this as ?the dash.? What are you going to do with that dash between the date of your birth and the date of your death. Similarly, how would you summarize your life or what you wanted to be remembered by, in such a short space.

While letting question process in the background of my mind for a few days, I stumbled upon a song on [one of my CDs](http://www.superchickonline.com/music_bfp.php) (find the song ?We Live? that I was listening to on the way to work. The chorus struck me instantly as what I would want on my tombstone. Augmenting the lyrics a little, my tombstone would read as such:

> He lived.  
> He loved.  
> He forgave.  
> He never gave up.

Each one is simple, but can be unraveled to expand a lifetime of adventures, thinking, and shaping of who I am, and who I am for others, and most importantly, who God wants me to be.

What do you want your tombstone to say?
