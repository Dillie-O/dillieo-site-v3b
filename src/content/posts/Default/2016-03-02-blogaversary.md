Roughly 7 years ago, I started out on this adventure called blogging. Interestingly enough, the saying that "the more things change, the more things stay the same" is ringing true here.

Last year, I did a big "blog renovation" of sorts by following the [10 days to a better blog](/new-year-new-me-sorta) series. In there I gave some serious thought to [why I blog](/why-i-blog), and interestingly enough, a lot of those core ideas are the same as when [I launched the blog](/sup-a-dillie-o) in the first place.

As I browse through the list of topics, I'm happy with what I see. There's a good amount of coding topics in there and a bit of "deep thoughts" along the way. There could probably be more of those in there, and that's something I'm trying to extract out of myself more.

I've had no "viral posts" to date, though I will say that I've had a rather large volume of traffic regarding unexpected things, such as [peeling frozen bananas](/quick-tip-how-to-peel-frozen-bananas), [swapping faces](/how-to-swap-faces-using-windows-live-photo-gallery), and [setting up a network TimeMachine backups using a Netgear router](/how-to-get-netgear-readyshare-to-work-with-time-machine-and-mountain-lion). I like to blog for me, so increasing numbers are nice, but not a personal measure of success.

Keeping this blogging has made me a better writer (minus my plethora of grammar and spelling gaffes) and a better software engineer. The way I see it, if I can explain some of these technical concepts to others in a way they can grasp, then I've demonstrated my own grasp on the concepts beyond the simple "works on my machine" functionality.

Here's to another year of blogging!
