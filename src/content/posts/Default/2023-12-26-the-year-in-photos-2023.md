| *Just a snapshot on the year* |

It's easy enough to say "this was the biggest year yet" but this year really changed on how to define that. Family lost, new family arrived, reunions with family that haven't been seen in a long long time. Left a job after over a decade I didn't think I would ever leave; found a new job that's better than I ever thought possible. Stress lost, margin found. Laughter, tears, memories, experiences, new perspectives gained. I feel more refreshed than I have been in a while and excited to tackle 2024.

Here are [a few highlights](https://photos.app.goo.gl/asdy2gQzHfP17tNK9) on the year.

More writing to come ahead!
