I’ve been a long time fan of the house and trance music. There’s something about the beats, the mixing, the effects, and the vocals that can be mind blowing. I also like the fact that a lot of these mixes are an hour long provides for a “long form” way of expressing a lot of complex music and emotions that you can’t easily shove into 3 or 4 minutes of music.

Enter the Reverence mix by DJ Lorraine. It is this mix that introduced me (and got me hooked) to house and trance. I first heard this mix through an old podcast called [The Dance Chapel](http://dancechapel.wordpress.com) when I was first looking for some good music like this to get me through the grind at work. Take a peek at the opening lyrics at the start of the mix:

> “There is just one place I long to be, blinded by your presence I can see, words divinely whispered in my ear, awakening my senses dulled by fear
>
> Move spirit move…stir inside of me, move all through this groove, dying to set me free.
>
> Shining in a swirling sea of light, power to make everything alright, the veil of lies been lifted off my eyes, longing just to please you my soul cries.
>
> Move spirit move…stir inside of me, move all through this groove, dying to set me free.”

It just gets more amazing from there. DJ Lorraine, thanks for blowing my mind and giving me a love of house and trance!

If you’ve never really delved into the realm of house/trace, give this mix a listen. For those of you that are looking for a track listing, it’s here too (thanks to the Dance Chapel):
