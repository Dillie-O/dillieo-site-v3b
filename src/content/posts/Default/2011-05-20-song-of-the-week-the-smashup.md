So what do you get when you take Audio Adrenaline, Steven Curtis Chapman, and Grits? A pretty kickin' track, that's what!

A long while back, I was avidly trying to complete my Audio Adrenaline archives and searching through the iTunes store and stumbled across this weird song that had AA, Steven Curtis Chapman AND Grits together. Thinking maybe it was some live album (and I had a free song download), I decided to give it a whirl. Instead of a live album, I got a really clever "smash up" of the music track and the lyric tracks from the three songs! It turns out they had a whole album of them and eventually I got all of the tracks.

I only wish they made a follow-up album to it.

Enjoy!
