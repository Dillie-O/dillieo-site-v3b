Greetings friends and family...

If you've made it this far, thanks for taking a moment to read this (and see a cute picture of our girls 8^D)

The school that the girls go to are having a "Duck Derby" fundraiser this year. It's a pretty fun idea and here's how it works.

1. You purchase one (or more) "ducks" for \$10.
2. You receive a souvenir duck (pictured above) that has a number on it. This is your entry number.
3. On May 27th, the school hosts a duck derby over at the Verde River. A larger plastic duck, with YOUR number on it, is lined up with other ducks and released simultaneously down the river.
4. The owner of the duck that come across the finish line first wins \$1000!

Yep, it's that simple. You do not even need to be present to win.

Even better, we don't need the money until the 21st of May. So if you're interested in purchasing a duck (or a flock of ducks) to help support the girls' school and potentially win some money, all we need from you is the following:

- Your name.
- Your phone number.
- Your e-mail address (only if you want derby updates via e-mail)

That's it!

If you're interested, please drop Jen or I a line. My e-mail is dillieo@gmail.com and Jen's is preggomomma@gmail.com and we'll be happy to help you out. You can also call the house at 928.445.3234.

Thanks for reading!!!
