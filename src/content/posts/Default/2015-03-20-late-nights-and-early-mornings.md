Today’s [daily writing prompt](http://talk.desk.pm/t/daily-post-3-20-2015/1590) over at [Desk](http://desk.pm) asks a somewhat simple question:

> What keeps you up at night?

For me, it’s a bit of what keeps me up at night and what gets me up early in the morning...

I’ve been spending some late nights and early mornings on the following:

### Books

I’ve been reading through Hugh Howey’s [_Shift_ series](http://www.amazon.com/Shift-Omnibus-Silo-Saga-2/dp/1481983555/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1426887908&sr=8-1&keywords=hugh+howey+shift) (definitely read [Wool](http://www.amazon.com/Wool-Hugh-Howey/dp/1476733953/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1426887940&sr=8-1&keywords=hugh+howey+wool+omnibus) first!) and it has been riveting! I first read the [City of Ember](http://www.amazon.com/Books-Ember-Omnibus-Jeanne-Duprau-ebook/dp/B0084U4KC2/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1426887988&sr=8-1&keywords=city+of+ember+omnibus) series and while they seem to start off with the same general “mystery”, the Silo Series (Wool, Shift, Dust) takes it to a completely different level. I’m hooked! I think you will be too.

In the mornings as part of my devotional time I’ve been reading [_Hearing God_](http://www.amazon.com/Hearing-God-Developing-Conversational-Relationship/dp/0830835695/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1426888077&sr=8-1&keywords=hearing+god) by Dallas Willard. It has really been opening my eyes into how to developer a deeper conversation with God, and that often times I overcomplicate things.

### Pet Project

Some nights and mornings are also spent to getting my [Prayer Journal](http://prayerjournalapp.wordpress.com/) project out and functional. I’m \_soooo close \_to getting the [new platform](https://prayerjournalapp.wordpress.com/2014/12/23/platform-shift/) up and running, but there always seems to be one last little thing to fix before it is in something of an alpha shape.

Sure I have lost a few bits of sleeping hours over the last couple of weeks, but as long as I can balance it out I’m finding all this time rather enriching, entertaining, and educational!

What keeps you up at night?
