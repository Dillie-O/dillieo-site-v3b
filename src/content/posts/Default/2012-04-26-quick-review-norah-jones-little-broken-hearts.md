My wife and I are HUGE Norah Jones fans. She has this soulful sound that is truly unique to her. While her voice sometimes seems light and soft, it is ALWAYS full of strength. I was extremely excited to see that her new album is coming out in a month. I was even more excited that for a limited time you can listen to the entire album online for free [here](http://www.npr.org/2012/04/15/150302373/first-listen-norah-jones-little-broken-hearts) (thanks NPR!). I'm no music critic, and I've only been through the album about three times in the last day, but I figured I'd have to share some quick thoughts.

I'll admit I was a little worried when I first started up the album. Norah's last album "The Fall" (I consider the collection of compilations "...Featuring" as a seperate work). It seemed to me that she was going a little too much down the "pop music" route and I'm not that much into that. Don't get me wrong. I love some of the folks and fun music she has sone on other albums. It simply reminded me a bit of when Harry Connick Jr. Released his "She" and "Star Turtle" albums. I'm enough of a fan to listen to them, but it stays out of my normal play cycle.

Regardless, and to get back on track, I found "Little Broken Hearts" to be very well done. Her opening track "Good Morning" isn't a jazz number, but it contains all of the soulful and powerful music you're used to her. The second chart "Say Goodbye" does have a pop sound, but there's something quirky about it that makes it fun. Overall the album shows her going back a little more into the jazz style, and has some very moving songs. "Miriam" seems almost hauntingly sad "Happy Pills" is a very fun chart.

So I'm excited to add this album to our collection when I get a chance to. In the meantime, thanks Norah for allowing us a [FULL listen](<I'm no music critic, and I've only been through the album about three times in the last day, but I figured I'd have to share some quick thoughts. >) to your album!
