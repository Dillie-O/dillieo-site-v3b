I take no credit for this! It’s all a HT to my wonderful wife, and it has helped out so many times now!

Don’t you hate cutting cold butter, especially once your bagel is ready? Sure you can pull out the stick at the same time you put the bagel in the toaster, but sometimes it isn’t soft enough.

Instead, put your knife over the “vent” of the toaster. It’ll get nice and warm while the bagel toasts, and cut through your butter like a lightsaber.

Problem solved!
