I’ve always been of the belief that love is found more in the simple things of life than in the huge gestures.

I’ve been blessed to have been married for nearly 14 years now and while I remember the special trips we have taken, I remember more the simple nights reading on the deck until we couldn’t stay awake or the movie marathons at home with burritos or pizza. Korean artist Puuung has [beautifully captured](http://www.grafolio.com/puuung1/illustration.grfl) these kinds of moments in a series of drawings. The one above is my current favorite. I think I’ll be returning often to browse through them.
