As a remote worker, I keep in touch with my colleagues by way of the “[daily virtual standup](/a-fresh-perspective-two-years-and-counting-as-a-remote-worker)”. This is a short and sweet e-mail that outlines _what I did yesterday_ and well as _what I’m going to do today_. Oddly enough, Outlook for Mac **does not** have a mail template that I could create to send these out faster! So here’s a quick trick I use as a workaround...

You can make your own e-mail “templates” by simply hacking up a signature. Do the following:

1\. Start a new e-mail message. Enter the default text that you want.

2\. Hilight the entire message (or use CMD+A) and copy it to the clipboard.

4\. Click the + button to add a new signature. Paste in your content, then click the “Untitled” section and rename your signature:

Hope this helps!
