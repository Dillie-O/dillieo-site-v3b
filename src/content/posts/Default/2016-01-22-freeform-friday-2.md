_Simply write about the first thing that comes to your mind …. NOW!_

Books!!!!! I found this really interesting article a while back called "[10 Books You Pretend to Have Read (And Why You Should Really Read Them)](http://io9.gizmodo.com/5924625/10-science-fiction-novels-you-pretend-to-have-read-and-why-you-should-actually-read-them?utm_campaign=socialflow_io9_facebook&utm_source=io9_facebook&utm_medium=socialflow&utm_expid=66866090-67.e9PWeE2DSnKObFD7vNEoqg.0&utm_referrer=http%3A%2F%2Fio9.com%2F5924625%2F10-science-fiction-novels-you-pretend-to-have-read-and-why-you-should-actually-read-them%3Futm_campaign%3Dsocialflow_io9_facebook%26utm_source%3Dio9_facebook%26utm_medium%3Dsocialflow)" and I've taken it upon myself to do so!

I'm going out of order, but I've started with [Asimov's Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_series). I'm going to read the "original three" to start and then branch out to others. I remember back in junior high trying to read Foundation and getting bored with it pretty fast. But starting it up again, this book feels like a "legacy" type book spanning multiple generation, and I really enjoy the long story at this point, probably not so much back then. 8^D

Speaking of books, I also finished off the first book in the [Molly Fyde series](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6828998-molly-fyde-and-the-parsona-rescue) by Hugh Howey (of Wool acclaim). I'll admit that it wasn't as gripping in the beginning as Wool was for me, but I started to enjoy the plot and character development involved. Plus there are some really interesting aliens in the mix here. While I won't be devouring them as fast as I did Wool, I'm definitely going to work through the series.

What books have you been reading lately. What ones are you planning on starting?
