I was checking my WordPress stats the other day and an received a “note” that my blog was 6 years old this week! Where does the time go! Being the curious sort that I am, I decided to hop in the old time machine and see what I was doing back then.

Surprisingly enough, I was doing a lot of the same things now as I was doing then. My first main post covered getting Log4Net off the ground (since I hadn’t seen any large tutorials out there) and the I followed up with how mentoring was helping others as well as myself. I had some more fun recollecting my computers since I was a kid.

The balance is all there, even before I decided to really flesh out [why I blog](/why-i-blog). It seems like my older blog posts are more conversational. It could be I’m being more reminiscent, it could be I cared a lot less about keywords and general flow to my articles and I’m trying to be a bit more formal now. Who knows, but I’ll go back and read a bit more and see.
