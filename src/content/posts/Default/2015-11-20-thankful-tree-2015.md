With Thanksgiving arriving next week, we have a tradition where we write things on leaves and add them to a “thankful tree” in the house. Here are three things that are going up on my tree this year.

### Time Off

It’s been a rather crazy year with work, working on two major projects simultaneously. Most of my time off the last couple of years has been consumed by travelling to doctors appointments, but not this year! Being able to spend the time either travelling for our big family vacation to Texas or taking a day off to simply see a movie and play board games has been doubly important for me this year.

### My Kids

My kids teach me so much about myself and give me a small glimpse at how God loves me (despite all of my failures 8^D). This year they really seem to be coming into their own and it’s a beautiful thing to see. They still give me plenty of excuses to goof around and have fun. I’m proud at the young girls they are becoming and excited to see what their future holds. I'm humbled that I have the opportunity to guide them along the way.

### Weather Station

I’ve been _itching_ for [one of these](/unboxing-and-initial-review-acurite-2032crm-pro-weather-station) for years now and finally was able to get one for my birthday. It’s fun to track the weather daily to see patterns and give my kids a little bit of science along the way. It’s a great conversation starter and if I can get a Raspberry Pi setup, I’ll have my own little “dot” on the weather underground site to track my weather from anywhere. Sometimes it’s nice to be thankful for the “not so profound” things.

What about you? What are you thankful for this year?
