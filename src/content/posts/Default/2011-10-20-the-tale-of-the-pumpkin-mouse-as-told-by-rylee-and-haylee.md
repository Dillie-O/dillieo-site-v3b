The mouse was finding a home, because he was soaking wet. And it was raining. Then the sun came out. Then it started snowing. Then it started getting cold. It was Autumn.

Then he found a cheese ax and chopped some wood. Then he ate the ax. Then the sun came out and he saw a pumpkin. Then he ate a hole in the top of the pumpkin. Then he ate inside. Then he had mouse friends to have a sleep over.

They played and had games. They all got cheese axes and chopped ever piece of wood. Then they were so hungry they ate their axes. Then they had a pot. Then their mother mouse came.

Then they lived happily ever after.

The End.
