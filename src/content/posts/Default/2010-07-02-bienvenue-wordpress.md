Well, here I am on WordPress 3.0.

Some of you may be wondering why I'm rolling a new blog engine, and a PHP based one at that _\[yeah Mr. .Net Junkie!]._

I have nothing against BlogEngine. I love it. I recommend it for any .Net folks out there that want to do get into blogging and tweak with their themes/plugins a bit. You'll feel quite at home there. I was impressed with the layout of it when I went through the process of migrating Disqus into my theme.

Lately though, my side work has drifted into the realm of WordPress (through my support of [Evangelical Outpost](http://evangelicaloutpost.com) as well as some upcoming work with [The Prescott Project](http://theprescottproject.com)). I felt it best if I could get some more hands on work with WordPress and PHP. As they say, "Never stop learning" right? I've already gotten back in the groove a bit by modifying a BlogML import script out there to work with 3.0 so I could migrate my posts in. More details on that later.

Enjoy!
