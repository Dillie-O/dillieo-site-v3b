This year our Thankful Tree is a bit more "virtual" so I'm pulling one one of my favorite older trees up in it's place. While I've been made more aware of the plethora of blessing I have on a day to day basis, here are my top three for this year.

## Men's Bible Study

Over the past few years I've been participating in a men's bible study during the Spring and Fall seasons. While some of the members come and go, there have been a core group of guys that I've been able to really connect with. It's amazing how few times men are willing to open up and go through the struggles (and there have been some huge ones) of life together, yet here is a sanctuary in which to do so. There have been some amazing things that have happened this year though the group and I'm thankful to have been a part of it.

## Friends I Disagree With

I think most of us are quite thankful that the political season of 2016 is finally over (or is it?). While I've typically kept out of politics, it was hard not to this year. Despite the massive arguments, trolling, and other disrespect that was everywhere, I was really thankful that I have a group of friends on all sides of the political and religious spectrum that knew that "people are more important than ideas" and had a lot of good insights on the issues and the people this year. My eyes were opened to a lot of things I really haven't thought deeply about before, and I'm thankful to be able to continue have these discussions moving forward.

## Running

This year I got back into running in a big way by being captain of our RAGNAR team. It was three years since I had done the RAGNAR (and ran consistently) and it was quite a trek to get there. However, I had some [profound experiences](/serenity) during that time and was able to run with my best friend whom I haven't seen in quite a while, let alone actually run with! I've been pretty consistent in keeping with my running regimen as well (still adjusting to lack of morning light though 8^D) and I feel better physically and mentally from it. Running is one of those times I can leave everything and get closer with God and I'm extremely thankful for it.

What are you thankful for this year? Happy Thanksgiving!!!
