I modified this recipe slightly from it's [original](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/nigella-lawson/one-pan-sage-and-onion-chicken-and-sausage-recipe/index.html), but it was so amazing I should have made a double batch. The recipe is extremely simple, and the way the flavors all blend together at the end will make you coming back for more.

**Ingredients**:

- 1 Large Onion
- 1/2 c Grape Seed Oil (or olive oil)
- 3 heaping tsp course grainy mustard (or deli mustard)
- 1 tsp dried sage
- Ground Pepper
- 1 tbsp Worcestershire Sauce
- 1 lemon
- 10 pieces Raw Chicken Tenders/Strips

**Directions**

1. Cut the onion into eighths and put it in a freezer bag, or dish to marinade.
2. Add the oil, mustard, dried sage, a healthy dash of pepper to the marinade.
3. Cut the lemon in half, and squeeze the juice into the marinade. Then cut the lemon into eighths and toss them in to the marinade.
4. Add the chicken and mix everything together well. Let the chicken soak for a minimum of 30 minutes, but going overnight really adds to the flavor.
5. When you're ready to cook, preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. If the chicken has been marinating for a couple of hours, let the chicken come to room temperature before baking.
6. In a 9x13 casserole dish, add the entire ingredients of the marinade and chicken. Take the sausage and frame it around the edge of the casserole dish.
7. Cover the baking dish with foil.
8. Bake for 1 hour and 15 minutes. Half way through you will want to turn the sausage over for even cooking.
9. Take the casserole dish out of the oven and open one end of the foil to help it cool, but don't let all of the steam escape.
10. Try not to eat it all at once.

What I love about this recipe is the slight tanginess of the mustard and lemon combined with the very earthy taste of the sage and pepper. The Worcestershire sauce adds a richness to everything. The fat from the sausage soaks into everything, and the onions take on almost a buttery like taste. I typically cut the sausage into smaller circles, and mix it all together on my plate, making sure to get a taste of everything in one bite. Using the chicken tenders saves a bit of prep time, and makes for some perfect serving portions. Again, you just may have to double this recipe, it fed 5 of us, all wanting more. Oh, just keep an eye out for the lemons, they'll look a lot like the onion after the baking, but they still don't taste that great. 8^D

Enjoy and let me know if you try it out! I think I'm going to make some more.... and it is breakfast time as I'm writing this!
