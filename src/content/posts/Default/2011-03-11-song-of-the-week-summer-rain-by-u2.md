[![U2 B-Sides Cover](@assets/images/posts/2011-03-u2bsidescover.jpg)

I've been re-ripping my CD collection to my computer lately and am pulling up a lot of the "oldies but goodies" that I enjoy and figured hey, might as well try to do some weekly music sharing to give you something to listen to.

To kick things off, I'm pulling up something from U2. I've been a long time fan and one of my favorite tracks comes off of their \_B-Sides 1990-2000 \_album called "Summer Rain" The music is light and the lyrics are profound:

<!--more-->

> When you stop seeing beauty you start growing old The lines on your face are a map to your soul When you stop taking chances you'll stay where you sit You won't live any longer but it'll feel like it
>
> I lost myself in the summer rain I lost myself I lost myself in the summer rain In the summer rain
>
> Tequila and orange Jamaica and rum At the Moreilla honey on my tongue In a small boat on a generous sea you let me be your enemy Tiny hand with a grip on the world Holding our breath now diving for pearls
>
> I lost myself in the summer rain I lost myself I lost myself in the summer rain Oh oh, oh oh
>
> Just as you find me always I will be A little bit too free with myself Just as you find me always I will be A little bit too free with myself
>
> I lost myself in the summer rain I lost myself Now there's no one else In the summer rain
>
> Raining down, it's raining down It rain Raining now Raining now
>
> Just as you find me always I will be A little bit too free with myself Just as you find me always I will be A little bit too free with myself
>
> It's not why you're running? It's where you're going? It's not what you're dreaming? But what you're gonna do?
>
> It's not where you're born It's where you belong It's not how weak But what will make you strong?

Give it a listen and I think you'll enjoy it too. More to come next week!
