![My development setup.](@assets/images/posts/2011-05-sam_1250.jpg)

Tomorrow I start my new job at [Fresh Consulting](http://freshconsulting.com), for which I'm extremely excited. As part of the process, we both agreed that I should be ready to hit the ground running once I get up there and have my developer setup ready to roll. They have been VERY gracious in supporting me and here is the result!

So what you're looking at here is the following:

- MacBook Pro - For all my basic/mobile editing needs.
- Acer 23 inch monitor - Great for the dual screen setup you see.
- Microsoft Natural Keyboard Elite 4000 - I've used these for about 5+ years now.
- Logitech Wireless Trackball M570 - You either love them or hate them, and I LOVE them!

But wait, you may notice there's a Windows 7 wallpaper showing up on the screen. In my role I'm going to be developing on all fronts, and I need a solid .Net environment for me to work in. The solution? VMWare Fusion. I was able to get Windows 7 and Visual Studio 2008/2010 Express on there in no time, as well as SQL Server 2008 Express on there for any database work I need. I've also have a Ubuntu install setup through Fusion as well just in case I need it. What I REALLY like about Fusion is that it gives me a "Unity Mode" where the "box" that the OS sits in goes away and I can work with the applications as native apps on the screen.

My software rig is looking like this:

- Text Wrangler - Basic code updates
- XCode / MonoDevelop / PhoneGap - Potential mobile solutions
- VMWare Fusion
- Kindle App for OSX - For my reference materials and the occasional fun read on the plane.
- SQL Server 2008 - For DB Work
- Visual Studio Express 2008 / 2010 - Apps for both .Net Frameworks
- TOAD for MySQL / SQL Server - Toad is the best DB explorer out there AND its free. Try it!
- ...and I'm sure there's other stuff I'm forgetting about too.

I'm quite excited because with this setup, I don't think there is anything I can't do, unless my twisted sense of imagination doesn't dream it up. For that I can only tip my hat to Fresh and say here I come and I won't let you down!

Oh, you may notice a little black device off to the side of everything on the desk. That's Whister 2.0, my 32 GB iPod Touch 4th generation that was a congratulations / father's day / birthday gift from the family. I'm VERY happy with Whistler and was touched my wife thought of me to make this happen. I'm already doing tons of fun things (like photos from a hike with the girls) as well as tracking my flight information and rental stuff on it. We even tried out Skype on it once so the family can chat with me when I'm gone on my trips up to Bellevue.

And of course, you have to have a lightsaber next to you at all times. 8^D
