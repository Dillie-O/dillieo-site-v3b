Yesterday at a birthday party, the girls got a silly/crazy/wiggly/ straw as a party favor.

This morning, Rylee was asking for a juice box to drink.

For some reason, the two items came together to form the super juice box and all it took was an extra two seconds to wiggle the original straw around to make the hole large enough for the super straw.

Rylee is quite happy with her surprise. Haylee doubly so. 8^D

I'll have to remember this one, maybe start a series or something. Anybody else have some daddy/mommy tricks out there to share?
