When you house is up on a hill, pretty much every run you go on is going to require an uphill climb to get back to where you started. Hmm, maybe there is something profound there, maybe not.

I've been working on my RAGNAR training and have reached some new milestones and observations. There's a point where you finish a run, and while you feel great, your legs are sore, you give yourself a headache, your lungs are extremely fatigued, and the rest of the day you barely trudge through. This is when I've overworked myself. It's okay to do on some days, but most of the time not, especially when you have to put in 8 hours of work and do other duties.

There's another point where you finish a run and while your feel great, the run was pretty brutal. There were those three ugly hills you had to tackle at mile 6 (of a 9 mile run) and your opening pace may have been a little too aggressive that your pacing at the end suffered (especially on said ugly hills). However, when you finish, your body is tired, maybe a little sore, but a shower, hydration, and a few hours off your legs and you're feeling pretty decent again. This I consider fatigue. The sign of a good overall workout and the motivation for the next one.

I'm striving more for fatigue than overworking myself now, and it's starting to pay off, especially on the long run days. It means I'm getting a solid base of miles on my body that I can build from and it is exciting.
