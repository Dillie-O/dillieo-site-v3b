_Simply write about the first thing that comes to your mind .... NOW!_

It’s not that I necessarily have writers block at times, it’s just that soemtimes I get too worried about what I’m going to write, and one of the best blogging times was early in the “[10 days to a better blog](/10-day-retrospective)” series I did where I was to simply “just write”.

Powerball mania has come and gone again and admittedly I was sucked into it. I only spent a whopping 12 bucks total, but it made me start to wonder where the tipping point is at where things get exponential in purchasing. This small town had a few lines outside of the convenience stores and you could hear people talking about it. Now that are winner and things are back to normal, I’ll forget about it again, and think about what if those numbers from Lost are powerful enough. 8^D

I’ve started reading Henri Nouwen’s “The Inner Voice of Love” and it is an unexpected and powerful read. They are journal entries, and not large ones at that. The author encourages us to only read one or two entries at a time, because they are powerful words from a time of extreme anguish that he went through. Rather profound was today’s entry about having to “choose” the truth, even when you don’t feel it. This is a muddled description, better to just quote it:

> You must believe in the yes that comes back when you ask “Do you love me?” You must _choose_ this yes even when you do not experience it.

I remember back in college during one of my Torrey sessions where our instructor talked about this a little bit as well. Some times we command ourselves (just like in the psalms) to “Bless the Lord, O my Soul”, even when we are feeling alone, lonely, doubtful. Oddly enough the soul obeys. It make for an immediate turn around, but I think it helps bridge that head/heart gap that we can so easily have in our beings.
