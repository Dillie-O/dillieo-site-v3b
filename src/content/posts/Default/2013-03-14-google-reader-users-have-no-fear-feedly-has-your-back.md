I was rather distraught (just like a lot of other folks) when Google announced yesterday that it was [shutting down Google Reader](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/03/a-second-spring-of-cleaning.html). [I've been a long](/lifestyle-management-reloaded-feedl) time [Feedly](http://feedly.com) user, and my blogs synchronizes directly through Google Reader. I wasn't sure which direction I would go. Until Feedly swooped in and saved the day!

I checked the Feedly blog this morning and they have [announced](http://blog.feedly.com/2013/03/14/google-reader/) that they have been working on their own google reader type API for their users. Any existing accounts will be automatically synchronized and transitioned to the "Normandy" server by July 1.

What does this mean for you? Three simple steps!

1. Install [Feedly](http://feedly.com). You can get it for your browser, iPhone, Android, tablet, they have it everywhere!
2. Get used to using Feedly. They've setup [a new post](http://blog.feedly.com/2013/03/14/tips-for-google-reader-users-migrating-to-feedly/) to show you all its great features.
3. Enjoy your reading experience without interruptions!

This makes me very excited. Feedly was very proactive in it's planning and I think they'll continue to provide a wonderful experience.

Go give them a try! I think you'll be pleasantly surprised!
