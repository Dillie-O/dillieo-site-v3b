In an unexpected change of events during the morning, I wound up hauling a piano in my truck to my house. In an even bigger twist, I wound up giving a nice elderly man (I think he said he was 72) a ride home since he lived maybe a block from me...

As I was walking with the man over to the trail that would lead him home, he notes my shirt and says, “Oh are you a doctor?” I replied, “No, but I love this TV show on called _Doctor Who_. Have you heard of it?"

He thinks for a moment and says, “Oh, I think so, the guy with the scarf, right?"

“Exactly!” I reply and smile.

I hope the show goes for another 50 years 8^D
