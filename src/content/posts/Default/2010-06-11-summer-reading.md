Just a quick note that I had a small mention on the [Evangelical Outpost](http://evangelicaloutpost.com/archives/2010/06/summer-reading-symposium.html) site where I am helping keep all the technical bits in order. You should take a peek at the list and find some good summer reading.

I'm already about half way through Dallas Willard's _The Divine Conspiracy_ and it is blowing my mind! There is so much stuff I missed the first time I read it about 10 years back and my outlook on things is changing. Give it a read!

As a side note, I was also fortunate to get a small [feature](http://evangelicaloutpost.com/archives/2010/05/farewell-to-lost.html) to post my thoughts on the LOST series finale, if you're curious.
