If you’re familiar with the recipe, there is such a thing as a “cuban” Panini sandwich. The distinguishing factor to them are the tang of the deli mustard and pickles in it.

Last night we were craving a grilled cheese sandwich, but needed a little more to it than just the cheese and bread. So after a quick raid of the fridge, I tossed together the following ingredients:

- Bread
- Butter
- Cheese
- Ham
- Deli Mustard
- Dill Pickles (cut into lengthwise slices, though they sell them in the jar this way too. Make sure you dry them off a little bit so the juices don’t run.

Items in hand, I went about the typical grilled cheese process. Butter the bread on one side, and put it on the hot grill. I then put down a good helping of deli mustard to cover the slice, then put the cheese, ham, and pickles on top. Put a little more deli mustard on top (depending on how much you like) and top with another piece of buttered bread.

Make your grill cheese as usual and enjoy! It turned out a LOT better than I expected. We had simple white bread, but next time I’ll try it with a good sourdough or rye bread.

Enjoy!
