While there may be nothing spectacular when you first look at it, the fact that this kind of technology is available for us to work with today through "over the counter" means is amazing.

With only a little help from me to get the program running on her laptop and help her explore how a few of the settings tweaks work, she was off and running on her own. You can see her eyes light up more and more as each little tweak to the program had immediate results on the robot. When her sister woke up, the collaboration and ideas cranked things up to an 11.

I can't wait to see what they come up with next!
