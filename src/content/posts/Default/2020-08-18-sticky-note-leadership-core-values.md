I’ve been away from my office desk for a few months now, but when I was bringing stuff home, I made sure take a snapshot of the sticky notes I refer to for daily insight and inspiration. This one reminds me what matters most in my day to day.

Last year a group of us got together to read a few books about leadership, growth, and a few things in between. The book that stood out most to me was Brené Brown's _[Dare to Lead](https://www.amazon.com/Dare-Lead-Brave-Conversations-Hearts/dp/1785042149)_. There have already been tons of great reviews, so I won't mention that here, just go buy a copy and thank me later.

One of the big exercises in the book is to identify your two core values from a rather [big list](https://daretolead.brenebrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Values.pdf). These values are the things most important to you and influence your work and non-work life in profound and subtle ways. Better said...

> When I facilitate this work in organizations, I always get this question: “Do you want me to identify my professional values or my personal values?” Here’s the rub: We have only one set of values. We don’t shift our values based on context. We are called to live in a way that is aligned with what we hold most important regardless of the setting or situation.

After some filtering, testing, and struggling, I came to the two values I consider my core:

## Community

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

It's probably because I'm a "[Protagonist](https://www.16personalities.com/profiles/91d78d2ade954)" type, but making sure the team, or the company, or the DnD group is in good shape, and working together, is something I really enjoy. Some people say I have a talent for it too. But I think most importantly, I see what amazing things can happen when the "Super Friends" unite, when Dumbledore's Army assembles, when Voltron assembles. It's a beautiful thing. And the growth and camaraderie that is fashioned through that lasts far beyond a piece of software that's shipped. If we're working 8 hours a day with people (sometimes more), I want to make sure these are people we trust and respect, and that's something I want to help build.

## Integrity

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

A wise elephant once opened statements with "I meant what I said and I said what I meant." That's what I strive to provide. If it's responding to an email, or completing some code for a a project amidst other demands, I want to make sure people can trust my word. When I say that a conversation is going to be private, it will stay that way. When I tell people they should go take a lunch break,[ I make sure to take one myself](/thoughts-on-leadership-what-you-permit-you-promote). It is this integrity that I see helping whether the storms of rocky projects, or tough talks with clients, and everything else.
