_Note: I can't take credit for this recipe, other than trying it out and loving it! You can get this recipe and others from _[_this book_](http://search.barnesandnoble.com/How-to-Grill/Steven-Raichlen/e/9780761120148/?itm=1&USRI=how+to+grill)_. It is the perfect book for beginners and experts. I highly recommend it!_

After getting some eager requests, and trying it myself, I had to share this Java rib rub recipe with you. It is nothing short of amazing, has a wonderful rich taste, with a few spots of sweetness or spiciness depending on where you bite into. I unofficially call this rub Perk dat Pig! Rib Rub. Here is the recipe:

- 6 tbsp Ground Coffee (the fresher the better)
- 2 tbsp Course Salt (I use Kosher Salt)
- 2 tbsp Brown Sugar
- 2 tbsp Sweet Paprika (regular works too)
- 2 tsp Black Pepper
- 2 tsp Garlic Powder
- 2 tsp Onion Powder
- 1 tsp Ground Cumin
- 1 tsp Ground Coriander
- 1 tsp Unsweetened Cocoa Powder

Simply combine those ingredients in a bowl and mix together. It actually works best if you use your hands, because you can use your fingers to break up the brown sugar clumps that sometimes. Put this in an airtight jar and it'll keep for a good 6 months.

How to make ribs? Well, here's the quick route I took with this latest batch.

1. Cover the meat side of the ribs with the rub. Be generous with the coat, but don't cake it on. Rub it in lightly, the salt and other spices will allow the flavor to soak in.

2. Wrap up the ribs in foil and let it sit in the fridge for at least 2 hours.

3. Fire up your grill and have the temperature set for the lowest temp in the grill range. I'll admit I don't do charcoal, so you'll want to get better guidelines in a book. I usually fire up all the burners to get to the setting quicker.

4. Once preheated, put your ribs on the grill, meat side down, for 2 minutes. While not proven, I like to put a light sear on the meat to help keep the rub and flavors in.

5. After the sear, transfer the ribs to a rib rack. This allows the fat to drip off the ribs and also keep the grates from cooking the meat too fast.

6. Let these bad boys cook for an hour and a half. Every 15 to 20 minutes, take a spray bottle full of apple cider vinegar and light spray down the ribs. This is the key to keeping the ribs moist during the cook process since we're not using a rub.

7. After the hour and a half (sometimes 2 if you need it). Pull the ribs off, let them sit for a few minutes to cook, cut and enjoy!

Now how can I prove these are so good? Up to this point Rylee has been rather reluctant to eat anything I've grilled, minus some simple chicken. She came over, took a bite of mine, and walked off with her own rib and ate half of it!

So I'm sharing the love with you. Give this a try and let me know what you think.
