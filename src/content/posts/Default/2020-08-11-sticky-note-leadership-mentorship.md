I've been away from my office desk for a few months now, but when I was bringing stuff home, I made sure take a snapshot of the sticky notes I refer to for daily insight and inspiration. This one I take to heart regarding mentorship.

Sadly I don't remember which book _or books_ they come from, but they are nonetheless valuable on their own.

For me, both of these quotes remind me that I need to "flip the script" as outlined in the books [_Leadershift_](https://www.amazon.com/Leadershift-Essential-Changes-Leader-Embrace/dp/0718098501/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=leadershift&qid=1597169900&sr=8-2) and [_Be the Boss Everyone wants to Work For_](https://www.amazon.com/Be-Boss-Everyone-Wants-Work/dp/1626566259/ref=sr_1_2?crid=2QDJTOFE7GM73&dchild=1&keywords=be+the+boss+everyone+wants+to+work+for&qid=1597169937&sprefix=be+the+boss+ever%2Caps%2C230&sr=8-2) I've read this past year. They really help emphasize the concept of servant leadership and how to orient your approach in a way that is focused on the unique needs of each person you mentor.

What quotes or books have influenced your leadership and/or mentorship of others? I'd love to read them!
