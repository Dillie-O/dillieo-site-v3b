Looking to add a bit of festiveness to your OSX terminal this winter? As long as you have ruby installed ([Superlumic](/new-tool-for-rebuilding-your-dev-environment) is a nice way to make this happen), simply drop this command into your terminal and enjoy!

Need a PowerShell script? I haven't tested it yet, but [this one](https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/scriptcenter/PowerShell-Snow-63c631ae) looks promising.

Merry Christmas!!!
