It's Thanksgiving this week, and while there are always a plethora of things to be thankful for, here are a few I shared around the dinner table with the family this past week...

### 3 Amazing Women in my Life

That would be my wife and my two daughters. While some men may cringe at being outnumbered 3 to 1, I learn so much from them and they help tailor my "computer geeky cards and games" side with princesses and nail painting. My wife knows me like nobody else does and the comfort and freedom in that is profound. It really can't be expressed in a simple couple of lines.

### My Job

At one level, I'm thankful for a job that puts meat on the table, a roof over our heads, and clothes to keep us warm. But even more than that, I have a career to improve myself with, and [an employer](http://freshconsulting.com) that gives me the flexibility to work non-standard hours when needed and new challenges and opportunities to expand my software craftsmanship. In the past year and a half I've learned more and worked on more new technologies than in the previous 8 years combined.

### Cactus Cooler

Hey, sometimes it's the simple things. A cold refreshing cactus cooler does the trick more often than not. 8^D

### God's Daily Provisions

More and more I'm realizing that all I need is my mana, or my daily bread. I learn more and more not to worry about what happened yesterday. More importantly, I learn not to worry about what will happen tomorrow, for therein lies a can of worms I don't need spilling into today's adventures. God provides my daily bread, just enough to make it through the day. While it seems frustrating that that little bit of extra money we had just went to fix the car, I'm learning that the money was there TO fix the car, instead of being stuck with one car or having to borrow more money. Day by day God provides, that's all I can really ask for.

How about you? What are you thankful for this year?
