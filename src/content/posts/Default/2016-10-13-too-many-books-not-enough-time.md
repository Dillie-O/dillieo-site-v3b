Earlier this year, I had signed up for a GoodReads campaign and set a goal to read 10 books by the end of the year. I'm a pretty slow reader, so I thought this was roughly a book a month.

To my surprise, I found that I've already reached that mark and might have a few more under my belt by year end! To my dismay, I found that I have only completed one of the books in my goal to go through the list of [10 Books You Pretend to Have Read (And Why You Should Really Read Them)](http://io9.gizmodo.com/5924625/10-science-fiction-novels-you-pretend-to-have-read-and-why-you-should-actually-read-them?utm_campaign=socialflow_io9_facebook&utm_source=io9_facebook&utm_medium=socialflow&utm_expid=66866090-67.e9PWeE2DSnKObFD7vNEoqg.0&utm_referrer=http%3A%2F%2Fio9.com%2F5924625%2F10-science-fiction-novels-you-pretend-to-have-read-and-why-you-should-actually-read-them). To be fair, I did read the entire Foundation trilogy when they only mention one. I'm also finding the "urban fantasy" genre to be a rather fun read at times.

\[:: sigh ::] Too many books, not enough time...

What's on your nightstand?
