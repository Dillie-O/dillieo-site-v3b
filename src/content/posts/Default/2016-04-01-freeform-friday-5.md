If you're an iPhone / iPad user, make sure you get the latest iOS update and enable the [night shift](http://www.apple.com/ios/updates/?cid=wwa-us-kwm-features&cp=ios9.3) feature that they enabled. I've been a long time user of [f.lux](https://justgetflux.com). I find a huge benefit on the eyes (and the sleep) that having a "warm" screen during the evening hours provides. The automatic shift based on the time is an added convenience. I noticed an immediate benefit at night when peeking at my phone. Now if they can only create a solid version for Android.

Microsoft continues to embrace making the right tools available for the right job, regardless of platform. A year or so ago they started releasing the .Net platform (open source too) to be runnable on Mac/Linux platforms thanks to the [ASP.Net Core](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/webdev/2016/02/01/an-update-on-asp-net-core-and-net-core/) platform. The other day, at the build conference, Microsoft announced that you can get a [full fledged bash prompt at the command line](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/DevelopersCanRunBashShellAndUsermodeUbuntuLinuxBinariesOnWindows10.aspx) in Windows 10. No cygwin, no fancy ports. A full fledged version of Ubuntu has been setup to be made available. This is huge in bridging the gap between the Visual Studio toolset used along side the vi/emacs/redis development typically available only in Linux. With these tools in place, who knows what machine I'll be "primarily" developing from in the future, and that's a good thing!

So now that you have your tech fix in, go disconnect for the weekend and fix your deck, or go for a run, or read a book (on paper) or something. 8^D
