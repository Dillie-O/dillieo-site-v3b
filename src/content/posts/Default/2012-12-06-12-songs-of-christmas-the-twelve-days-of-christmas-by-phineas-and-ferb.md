I'm a huge fan of Phineas and Ferb and their Christmas special didn't disappoint one bit! Even more fun was that they released all of their music from the special on a CD! Here's the gang singing their altered rendition of The 12 Days of Christmas. I think Dr. Doofenshmirtz really stole the show on this one!
