So there's Flikr, Facebook Photos, Picasa Photos, Instagram, and a plethora of other sites out there to host photos, but I've decided to do something a little more "homegrown" and start putting them in a WordPress blog.

The result is [Pic-a-Dillie-O](http://picadillieo.wordpress.com), another little blog where I can quickly post those photos. I'm really loving the Android 2.0 version of WordPress, and the sharing features will make it easier to put things there. That and I think WordPress is just a great platform. Plus with the special photo oriented themes available, it makes for a nice little digital cottage. [Give it a peek](http://picadillieo.wordpress.com) when you have a moment. I'll be getting some more photos and do a little more clean up on the site as time goes on.
