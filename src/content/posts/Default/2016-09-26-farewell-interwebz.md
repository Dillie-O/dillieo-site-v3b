This is a laterblog (is that a word?) but by now I've abandoned the internet (and a fair amount of connectivity) for a week and a half or so for vacation. You'd be surprised at what a good disconnect can do for the mind and soul and what kind of perspectives it can provide. You should try it sometime. I'll be somewhere in Texas for a while... Peace out!
