| *...it's my "Totoro Tree" and I'm thankful for it* |

It's been a good year to reflect. A lot of changes, even more growth, and I consider myself even more thankful for the things around me than I did the previous year. I believe it was Fr. Richard Rohr who mentioned that as you grow your perspective changes from "having what you love" to "loving what you have". With that in mind, here are 3 things (of many) to which I'm thankful for this year.

## Home

I feel like this one alwayys shows up on my list but it is ever present on my mind. My home has continued to be my [sanctuary](/sanctuary). A place to unwind, to escape, to serve others, to improve, to build memories within. 

## New Job

I still have a lot of unpacking to do around the shift, but in June I left my role at Fresh and started a new one as a Software Development Manager at [USAFacts](https://usafacts.org). While the transition has been a bit crazier than I thought it would be, I find myself back to a place where I can breathe once again. Where I can get deeper with an amazing (and still growing) team of engineers, and I reprioritize the things that are most important to me.

## Used Books

We've really doubled down on this one as a family. Much like how we did coffee runs as a family last year (and continue to do so), we've been leaning into finding used bookstores in the area, getting some boba tea, and shopping! Finding old treasures, new releases for dirt cheap, and enjoying the smell of paper oddly enough brings us together as a family and continues to make memories. The only problem it causes is increases my list on GoodReads. I suspect it'll never reach "inbox zero" 8^D.

## Et Vous?

What are you thankful for this year? It is more important than ever to find even the small things in your life and name them as we approach the grey of winter and cold it brings. There's also plenty of evidence to show how a mindset of thankfulness does wonders. I’d like to hear them!
