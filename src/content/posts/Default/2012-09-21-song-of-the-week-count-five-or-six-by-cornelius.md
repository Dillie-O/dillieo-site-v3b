I first stumbled across this song on an episode of Yo Gabba Gabba that my kids were watching a year or so back. While the video was a little odd, the music itself was oddly intriguing...

I'm not sure if it was the old band geek in me, or the constant drive of the song, or the unexpected tempo changes that occurred, but Cornelius stuck in my head, and when Spotify came out, I was able to get a full sample of his abstract and amazing tracks. After this track, check out some of his other tracks as well. My favorites (in addition to this) are Toner, Gum, Sleep Warm, and Music.

Enjoy!
