In honor of the upcoming holiday, I thought I'd spread some "spooky" cheer, provided by the guy who got me into the house/trance scene, Carey Jarvis of [The Dance Chapel](http://dancechapel.wordpress.com).

It's a great mix, and he even shared it on SoundCloud a while back.

Enjoy and Happy Halloween!!!
