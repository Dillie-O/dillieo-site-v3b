Another fabulous vacation has been road tripped, tractored, ran, ridden, faired, spidered, and so much more. I wouldn't trade these trips for the world. It provides a great getaway from the normal (and digital) day to day life that can sometimes overwhelm you. Here are a few of my favorite photos from the trip.
