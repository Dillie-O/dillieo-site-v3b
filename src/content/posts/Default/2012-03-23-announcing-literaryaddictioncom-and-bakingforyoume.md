My wife has been working VERY HARD over the last few months putting together book reviews, and gluten free recipes. A lot of this is reflective of the passions in her life. Today I'm proud to announce that she has a couple of domains launched to support these blogs!

[Literary Addiction](http://literaryaddiction.com) - Book reviews on a wide variety of topics. My honnie was nice enough to even let me post my Hunger Games Review there.

[Baking For You](http://bakingforyou.me) - Dedicated to Gluten Free living. Recipes, tips, ingredients, and more!

Go check them out and spread the word! I think you'll enjoy them immensely!
