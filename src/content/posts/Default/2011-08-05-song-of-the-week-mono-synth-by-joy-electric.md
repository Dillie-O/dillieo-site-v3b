You never know when you'll stumble across something completely random to you, and yet completely wonderful with music. Such was the case with me and Joy Electric.

<!--more-->

I had gotten into the dance/house scene late in high school, early in college, so I already had an affinity for more of the "digital" side of music, with heavy use of beat tracks, digital edits, and the like. However, when it comes to Joy Electric, they took a slightly different approach and went to the analog side of the electronic music scheme, which allows you to do some really amazing things.

Here's one of their tracks off of a sampler that shows a lot of the different effects in action. Enjoy!!!
