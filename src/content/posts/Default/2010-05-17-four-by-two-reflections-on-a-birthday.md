It's amazing how one day changes things. My girls turned 4 yesterday and it seems like overnight they became new girls all at once! I'm sure when I stop and think about it I can see the subtle changes. But for some reason, they looked a lot older today than the other day. They talked a lot older than the other day. They even acted a lot older than the other day. I reflected upon this a bit last night in my weariness and could only comment as follows:

> My girls turned 4 today. They were baptized, we had a kickin' party, and I'm feeling old. I am truly blessed.

When asked, the thing that still amazes me the most is how two souls born at the same time, in the same womb, can be so different. They aren't identical twins, so it makes sense that they would be different. But all the same, the differences still produce an awe that never ceases.

Rylee is our artist/drama queen. After waking up, she lasts about 10 minutes before asking if she can draw/paint something. I think I went through a ream of paper in about two weeks since I forgot about her coloring books. We're trying to figure out what to do with all the drawings, since she values them so much. All suggestions welcome. 8^D Rylee loves to dress up as well and has a purse I think she takes nearly everywhere now on errands with mommy.

Haylee is our adventurer. She fears nothing, or at least nothing she can't jump on/over/through. I'll place my bets she is the one that instigates playing in the dirt/mud and we typically have to pull her out of the sandbox for dinner. I don't know how she got so fast and there are honestly times when I can barely catch her. Haylee's generosity knows no end. On numerous occasions Rylee has had a fit because Haylee is wearing the shirt she wants to wear. In the midst of trying to explain to Rylee how sharing works, Haylee runs over, shirt in hand, and says Here sissy, you can wear it. without any sign of resignation. It melts us every time.

Despite the differences, they both love to go hiking and discover new things. They have a good sized back yard and there's lots of nature to see every day, and bugs (some good and some bad) to trickle by. They both love book and are quite proud of their very own library cards that they have. They both know who Jesus is and have an inkling of what he's done.

A couple days ago my girls were three. They were toddlers. Most of the time I felt like I was shepherding them to go here or there, and letting them babble. Now I have conversations with them, I teach a little, and I learn a little. What a profound new world we'll be entering and discovering.
