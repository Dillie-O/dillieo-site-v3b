In honor of seeing Star Wars Episode 1 in 3D last night, I thought it would be fitting to put in one of my favorite songs from the soundtracks!

John Williams is spectacular. He's done so much amazing soundtrack work, from Jaws, to the original Star Wars, to Indiana Jones, to Harry Potter, the list goes on and on. I was really excited when I first heard that Williams had been brought back to do the soundtrack for Episode 1, a good 15 years after he closed up shop with Return of the Jedi. One of the really unique things that Williams brought back this time was the use of vocals in his track to depict the epic duel between Qui-Gon Jinn, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Darth Maul. It captures everything perfectly, and adds a sense of intensity and grandeur (not delusional 8^D) to the scenes.

Sit back, wave around that lightsaber, and Enjoy!
