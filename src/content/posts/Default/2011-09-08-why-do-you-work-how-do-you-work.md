Chuck Colson did a [Breakpoint Commentary](http://www.breakpoint.org/bpcommentaries/entry/13/17762) at the beginning of the week that I didn't get a chance to listen to until this morning. He gave some really good insight on work and how we should view it. Take a couple minutes out to give this a listen. It's very thought provoking.
