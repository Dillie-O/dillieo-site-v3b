Here's another one of those "when two legends collaborate" type song for this week.

As you're already aware, Duke Ellington is my all time favorite jazz musician/composer. Louie Armstrong ranks right up there in the ranks as well. Most people know Louie for his singing voice (What a Wonderful World), but he's also an amazing trumpet player as well!

Needless to say, I about fell over when I stumbled across this album one day. I also discovered later on that in the [deluxe edition](http://open.spotify.com/album/1Fquufzod0wEcCXt6oYnCJ), you get a second disc with all the "in studio" edits. It feels like stepping into a time machine. I would have loved to have been a fly on that wall.

Enjoy!
