> Greater love has no one than this, that someone lay down his life for his friends. (John 15:13 ESV)

Thank you. As my family enjoys today, we do it knowing that our freedom came at a price, and that you were willing to make it. Sacrifice is no small thing to make, and you are honored for it. It seems so insignificant to write down a few words, but words to have power and at this moment in time I hope this small gesture provides lasting impact.

Thank you to my parents, grandparents, uncles, cousins, and others in our family that have served or are serving.

Thank you to my friends, both near and far, that have served or are serving today.

Thank you to the anonymous veteran that has stumbled upon this post. I don’t know you personally, but I know of your sacrifice and I appreciate it deeply.

Thank you to those no longer with us, having given your life so that people you will never know generations after your own could live free.

Thank you.
