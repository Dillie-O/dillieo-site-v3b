Another year has come and gone and being the data junkie that I am, it's time to take a peek and see what was new and interesting by the numbers...

## By the numbers: Down a Bit

My total views / visitors was down from the previous year, for the first time ever. It isn't a huge drop, but considering I was able to stick to my goal of averaging 2 blog posts a week, I was a little surprised that the traffic wasn't at least steady. Last year was the big "10 Days to a Better Blog" series, and community, that had fallen away, so maybe there is a chance that's where I was getting some extra traffic from. Ultimately [I blog for myself and to share the love](/why-i-blog), so the numbers don't phase me much, but the data junkie in me wants to tweak them out, dissect them, and find out why.

## Top Posts of the Year

Out of the 104 posts that went live this year, here are the top 5:

1. [Database Migrations with Azure EF7 and DNX](/database-migrations-with-azure-ef7-and-dnx) - I'm actually quite happy this is my top post because this was the biggest helper to me on a big project earlier this year and I was able to leverage some emerging .Net technology.
2. [Quick Tip: Run EntityFramework Migration Seeds for MigrateDatabaseToLatestVersion Configuration](/quick-tip-run-entityframework-migration-seeds-for-migratedatabasetolatestversion-configuration) - Another quick tip that saved my butt this year!
3. [Chapters](/chapters) - One of my newer posts, but one huge milestone for our family (spoiler: I was promoted and we're moving! 8^D).
4. [Bitcoin Alert – HashOcean: Potential Scam](/bitcoin-alert-hashocean-potential-scam) - I learned my lesson this year ([here's the followup](/bitcoin-alert-hashocean-diary-of-a-scam)) about making sure to check in to your Bitcoin resources thoroughly before investing.
5. [Soup to Nuts: Access VMWare Fusion .Net Apps from Your Mac](/soup-to-nuts-access-vmware-fusion-net-apps-from-your-mac) - Another big helper post for me that has made my .Net App web testing so much more powerful, since I can do immediate Safari / iPhone testing now as well.

## Something Old

It's funny how some things never change. For a musings on live / technology blog, my overall #1 post was still on [how to peel a frozen banana](/quick-tip-how-to-peel-frozen-bananas). It's kind of crazy that it's the 7th result on Bing and 3rd result on google if you search "how to peel a frozen banana". Maybe I should sell ad space now or something 8^D

## Something New

This past year I took up a GoodReads challenge and set a goal to read 10 books for 2016. I felt this was fair since I tend to be a slow reader. I surprised myself and [read 14 books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2016/42349498) (and sooo close to finishing #15!) and I really enjoyed it. I failed miserably at [the task that inspired my reading](/freeform-friday-2), but I think I still succeeded in the grand scheme of things. I'm already building a list for 2017.

## ...on to 2017

I still like the current routine I am in for blogging. Twice a week seems like a good routine, without being too pressured to get things done (though it did feel like it at a times 8^D). The "Freeform Friday" thing I put in mainly as a backup in case I forgot to post actually wound up being pretty fun and became pretty random (in a good way) I might try to make that a weekly ritual. I fell out of my morning routine for blogging and plan to return to that again, since I think the overall flow of the posts were better as well.

Here's to 2017 and what lies ahead!
