It's amazing to think that this morning I was doing something continuously for over an hour non-stop. Sure I've cleaned out the garage, or chopped firewood, or done various chores, but to put your body in a continuous "stressful" state (apparently an average of 169 bpm on my heart rate sensor and I have some hills to verify it!) for that long is something I haven't thought much about before. It's amazing what the body can do, how we're fearfully and wonderfully made, and how small changes (such as getting up and sticking to a routine) can lead to some amazing payouts after time. Running reminds me so much of the long game, of the benefits of self-discipline, self-examination, and of pacing that apply to the road, the trail, and to life.
