_Simply write about the first thing that comes to your mind …. NOW!_

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) is looking to be my new text editor of choice for small to medium text wrangling. It's free, fast, has an extensive extension library growing for it, and I can even do TypeScript, Node.js, and PHP debugging through it should I desire. It plays really nice with the .Net Core 1.0 stuff and I can launch things from the terminal/command prompt as well! Oh yeah, you can get it for OSX and Linux as well as Windows. Kudos Microsoft! Keep it up!
