In an effort to mix things up a bit, I'm taking my "Freeform Friday" down a slightly different road and will answer random questions I find out there. For starters, if I was stuck on a deserted island, the 5 books that I would want with me are...

#### The Little Prince, by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

No, I don't say this because I'm writing this while wearing my amazing Little Prince lithograph shirt either. 8^D This little book was an inspiration for me when I was younger and really helped me think outside the box in a lot of ways (is that a hat or an elephant that has eaten a snake). I was able to start reading it in French, which was equally enjoyable. There's a lot of good life lessons in there, and I think a bigger issue to cherish of being able to remain "child like" as you get older and not "childish".

#### Les Misérables, by Victor Hugo

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

I was first introduced to "Les Mis" through the amazing musical back in high school. Later on in college I picked up the book and was able to finish it while living in France for a month. The characters, the heartache, the triumph, all function at so many levels and embrace truths that still apply today. It's been a while since I've read the book, and I'm adding it as a goal to read for this year.

#### The Lord of the Rings, by J.R.R. Tolkien

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

I'm going to cheat a little on this one and say that I have a copy (which I do) that includes all three stories (Fellowship, Towers, Return) into one large edition and that was the one I was stranded with. I blame my sixth grade teacher for getting me hooked on middle earth. I subsequently read the series on the long bus rides to school in 7th grade while geeking out during lunch over these amazing characters, world, and the ultimate quest to be undertaken. I find it a joy to see one of my girls slowly reading through it now.

#### The Martian Chronicles, by Ray Bradbury

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

A lot of science fiction I've read has been as a part of a general series or spans multiple books, so I couldn't pack all of them and I would want to have something Sci-Fi with me. The Martian Chronicles however, was a standalone book by itself, and got me hooked on "multi-generational" books that span beyond the life of one person to see how they would be affected. It's also a good look at "humanity 2.0" in that we made it to Mars, but the circumstances of life there give the children that are born on Mars a distinctly different view on life.

#### The Bible

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The Bible is my foundation. It points me to the creator of the universe and the savior of my soul. It gives me the foundational precepts on how I attempt to live each day. It's hard to form words around its impact at times, but I know it would provide daily strength, inspiration, and comfort.
