![Quick Tip](../img_post/2013-01-25-quick-tip-fixing-duplicatehidden-dialog-anomalies-with-jquery-ui/2011-12-quicktip.jpg) I ran into an odd issue today with a modal dialog that was generated by [jQuery UI](http://jqueryui.com/ "JQuery UI").

<!--more-->

The modal dialog served to dynamically render a highcharts chart upon opening. For some reason, the second (and ONLY the second) time I triggered the event the chart wouldn't display. After doing some investigating, I found that I had TWO copies of my modal dialog wrapper in the [DOM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model "Document Object Model"). This was causing confusion with [highcharts](http://www.highcharts.com "Highcharts"), which would render the chart in the div that wasn't being displayed.

I looked into some of the .dialog('destroy') and .remove() calls, but nothing worked.

Fortunately, [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7099938/jquery-ui-dialog-behaves-unpredictably) came to the rescue again! (Big HT to [Milimetric](http://stackoverflow.com/users/180664/milimetric))

For brevity (and personal reference) here's the code involved.

```js
var original = $('#dialogId')[0];
var clone = $(original).clone().attr('id', 'dialogIdClone');
var saveHtml = $(original).html();
$(original).html('');

$(clone).dialog({
    ... // other options
    open: function (){
        // add any dynamic behavior you need to the dialog here
    },
    close: function(){
        $(clone).remove();
        $(original).html(saveHtml);
    }
});
```

Hope this helps!
