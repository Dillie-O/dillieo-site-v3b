![Cranberry Chutney](@assets/images/posts/2011-11-cranberrychutney.jpg)

This was my grandfather's recipe, and a wonderful addition to the Thanksgiving table. It has a tart taste, unlike your typically sweet cranberry sauce, so it can compliment other foods quite well. Jalapeno is optional

**Ingredients**:

- 4 c Cranberries
- 1 c Seedless Raisins
- 1/2 c Sugar
- 1 tbsp Ground Cinnamon
- 1/2 tsp Ground Ginger
- 1/4 tsp Ground Cloves
- 1 c Water
- 1/2 c Diced Onion
- 1/2 c Thinly Sliced Celery
- 1 Medium Apple, Peeled and Chopped
- 1/4 c Vinegar (Optional)
- 1/2 c Water (Optional)
- 1 Jalapeno Diced (Optional)

**Directions**

1. (Optional) Simmer vinegar, 1/2 c water, and jalapeno for 5 minutes in a pot.
2. Add cranberries, raisins, sugar, spices, and water to the pot and cook for 15 minutes, or until most cranberries have burst and the mixture is starting to thicken.
3. Add the rest of the ingredients and let simmer for another 15 minutes or until thick.
4. Let cool and refrigerate, or put into canning jars immediately and let cool on the counter.

Again, you'll find that the taste is tart, compared to sweet, but the balance of apples and onions and celery in the mix is very nice. You can always add a bit more sugar during the simmer process if you want yours sweeter, or a little more water to give things time too cook. The recipe is very flexible that way. I typically get rid of the membrane and seeds to reduce the heat, but if you're family enjoys the spice, keep it all in!

Enjoy and let me know if you try it out!
