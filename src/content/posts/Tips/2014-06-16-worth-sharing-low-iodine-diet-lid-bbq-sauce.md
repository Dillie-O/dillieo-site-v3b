Last week my wife started her LID (low iodine diet) and finding compatible foods with this diet can be tricky at times. No dairy, no fish, no salt (except for kosher) limits a lot of your options. However, I was able to modify a BBQ sauce recipe of mine that went great on some pulled pork we had last night.

## Ingredients

- 2 c no salt ketchup (Heinz makes this, maybe others)
- 1/4 c cider vinegar
- 2 tbsp honey
- 1 tbsp mustard (ground to a powder if you want)
- 1/4 c brown sugar
- 1 tsp kosher salt
- 1 tsp garlic powder
- 1 tsp onion powder
- 1/4 tsp ground pepper

## Directions

Mix all ingredients together in a pot. Simmer on low heat for 20 to 30 minutes until well blended. Let cool and transfer to a jar. You can store this in the refrigerator. Hopfully this helps you out in your LID cooking endeavors. We’re excited to try it on other recipes as well!
