Wow -- another year is swiftly coming to an end and while the blog has been quiet this year, there is still time to stop and reflect. I'm thankful for a lot of things, but a few that trickle to the top of my mind would be...

## Margin

I've really been trying to live into having more [margin](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/344825e0-3fdc-4d56-8d0b-28ac8ef5349b) in my life and it has been something I'm extremely thankful for. Those morning coffees with Jen on Mondays and Fridays. Enjoying some reading and a sunrise when I arrive early to the office. Taking [a minute to breathe](https://oneminutetobreathe.com). These small things have added up to something big.

## Rituals

The family's winter [Angband](/gaming-done-right-angband/) challenge. The bottle of [Beaujolais Nouveau](https://www.wineclubgroup.com/beaujolais-nouveau-thanksgiving-dinner/) with Thanksgiving dinner. The Friday night pizza and a movie. It's these things that we lean into and look forward to week over week, or year over year, that can add some familiarity, stability, and fond memories in crazy times.
