So here we are, a brand new year and I thought I'd go off on a tangent and see if I can shock and amaze folks with a few things you may not know about me...

## I Wear a Toe Ring

Yep, my "wild and rebellious" nature (plus my random interest in them) led me to get one. I convinced my wife to get one with me on our honeymoon in Hawaii. They match and I can always call it my "backup wedding ring" if something happens.

## Jeff Atwood Called Me Out Once

Yes, that [Jeff Atwood](https://blog.codinghorror.com), the co-founder of StackOverflow had an issue with the way I had [answered this question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/153524/code-to-logging-ratio#153547). He had enough of a concern that he even wrote a [blog post](https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-problem-with-logging/) about it. I appreciated the nod and his concern, but I still think I'm right, especially when you setup the tools to handling the logging right 8^D. For what it's worth, it even spawned a [followup question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/231903/how-much-to-log-within-an-application-and-how-much-is-too-much/231988#comment68719563_231988) on the issue as well.

## I Was a (2 Points Away From LV3) Yu-Gi-Oh Judge and Had A Popular App

After reading a random article in the LA Times, I was intrigued, and then hooked on the Yu-Gi-Oh trading card game. I drug my wife and brother in law into the mix. I was a bit sheepish about actually competing, so I wound up being a judge, which had a lot of rewards in it's own right. Along the way I joined up with a couple of people and built a deck building tool, as well as maintained the "unofficial official" rulings site for a while. It was kind of cool to help judge at a tournament and hear, "Oh you're the Deck Studio / Netrep guy. Thank you!" It's the small things. It's pretty old, but the code is available [here](http://ccgtoolkit.codeplex.com).

## Roy Osherove Hired Me Once

Yep, that [Roy Osherove](http://osherove.com), known for his test driven development, continuous deployment, and a few [cool tools](http://osherove.com/tools) back in the day (I love Regulator). I happened to been the right place at the right time when he was looking to have somebody help him migrate is blog to a new platform. I was a little nervous, but Roy was really nice, paid me a nice \$500 for about a week of work (helps when you have kids!) and made me open source the project (no complaints here). You can download that project [here](https://github.com/Dillie-O/blogmigrator).

## I've Been to France twice and Have NEVER Seen the Eiffel Tower

Yep, it sounds pretty crazy, especially considering each trip was a month long! I spent a couple of summers building some websites and doing volunteer work for an [amazing organization](http://editionscle.com) that helps give books, published material, software, and other resources into the hands of Christians in France. For both trips, I had to get off the plane and immediately grab the Subway / TGV to get out of Paris to my final destination. Both times when I flew in it was so overcast I couldn't see a thing out the window. C'est la vie. Maybe one day I'll make it back with the entire family.

## And You?

What random (and semi-famous?) things do people not know about you? It's always a great conversation starter.
