![S-I-M-P](@assets/images/posts/2012-01-simp.jpg "SIMP")

This week it's a song and video! If you haven't, go watch some episodes of Phineas and Ferb on Netflix. These kids are clever AND funny!

I'll save all the reasons I love this show for another post. Just watch this. The song is funny, creative, and oddly enough well put together and very fitting with the genre of music. 8^D

S to the I to the M to the P!!!!
