As a few of your folks may have noticed as of late, the dillieodigital.net domain is now forwarding over here to WordPress. Sadly the time has come where I need to close up the [digital cottage](/whats-in-a-domain-name) for a little while. I've been able to import all of the posts over, and hopefully I can make a few tweaks as I go along.

Most of the projects I've been working on over time already have a new home, and I'm working on getting a new home setup for the CCG Toolkit / Netrep Archives.

I'm also using my Gmail account as my primary account now, so feel free to hit me up using the contact page over here. I think most of you know how to get in contact with me otherwise.

While it would be nice if things were different, this will be an interesting experiment of moving more into "the cloud" for my "digital cottage" Instead of 1 permanent address, I'll have several, that are tightly connected.

That's the latest. Thanks for reading!
