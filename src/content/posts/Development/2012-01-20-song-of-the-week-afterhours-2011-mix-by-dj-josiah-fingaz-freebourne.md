This week we have another phenominal dance/house set from a guy I've been following for a little while now, [DJ Josiah "Fingaz" Freebourne](http://www.djjosiah.com)!

<!--more-->

This set comes thanks to [Tastyfresh](http://www.tastyfresh.com/2012/01/04/afterhours-2011-josiah-fingerz-freebourne/), where DJ Josiah was played the Cornerstone festival this past year. It took a while to get the mix posted online, but man was it worth it! The way Josiah puts the mixes together, continues to keep the high energy flowing it hard to top. Plus DJ Josiah keeps a message to honor God in all of his mixes.

Enjoy and try NOT to dance while listening to this mix! I failed after about 3 minutes into it. 8^D
