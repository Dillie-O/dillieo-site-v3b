![House Plant](@assets/images/posts/2012-03-houseplant.jpg)

We're going to take a quirky angle this week and listen to one of the "other" songs by my favorite band: Audio Adrenaline

<!--more-->

Set on the stage of the fictitious radio show, Smooth Steve of the show "Java the Hutt" is in the audience to listen to a song about the so called interent evils of Rock and Roll. Yeah, it's fun, and one of these days I'm going to get me a "skinny boy decaf latte no foam"...

Enjoy!
