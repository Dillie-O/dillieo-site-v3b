My first music love is jazz. I’ll admit I’m more of a classic jazz type person (Duke Ellington music to follow in the next few weeks), but along my “jazz journey” I stumbled upon Chick Corea. He does truly amazing things with the electric keyboard. But he really used a lot of different styles and instruments in the pieces he did.

One of my all time pieces is “La Fiesta” off of his “Works” album. While most of the music I found was in his “electric keyboard” style, this album features a violin and other instruments I didn’t typically associate with jazz. “La Fiesta” has a fast latin feel, combined with the electric keyboard and a soprano sax. There are “funny work” with some of the time and pacing, and is all in all an amazing piece. Enjoy!
