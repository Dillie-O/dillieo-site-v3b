I don’t know about you, but I’m in a bit of a fog coming out of the Christmas and New Years holidays.

<!--more-->

I’m rather festive when I celebrate the Season of Advent, so nearly all of my podcast and music listening goes out the door in favor of Christmas music. Between Christmas and New Years, there were four family celebrations, about 20 hours worth of driving, and 2 more gatherings with very close friends, so we’ll chalk that up to 6 family gatherings.

Added to all of this is the “gravity” that comes with the transition from one year to another. I’ve had lots to reflect upon with the events of last year. I also have lots to reflect up on about goals, resolutions, and ideas for this coming year. Family to run amok with, blog posts to write, books to read, things to do around the house, miles to run, apps to update, apps to build, it goes on!

All of this has left me in a bit of a fog. I know what I want to do, but I guess I just don’t quite know the when and the how, and I feel like I’m falling behind already. My week in the “dark” without the Internet was a good thing, and maybe I was too “jacked into the matrix” for my own good. We’ll see.

What about you? Do you get the New Year fog?
