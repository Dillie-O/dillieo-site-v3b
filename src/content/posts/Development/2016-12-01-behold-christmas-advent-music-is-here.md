> And the angel said to them, "Fear not, for behold, I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people. For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord." (Luke 2:10-11 ESV)

If you want to get technical, Advent technically started on Sunday, but I'm more of a December 1 kind of celebratory person. Nevertheless, Christmas Advent is here and one of the ways I love to celebrate is through music. Here's a plethora of options to get you started, thanks to the power of shared music online!

## Phat Chunk 'O Christmas

First and foremost is my classic Phat Chunk 'O Christmas collection. These are some of the original albums that I purchased and added to over time. There's something about hearing Harry sing "Sleigh Ride" or Vince Guraldi's Charlie Brown Christmas or The Manhattan Transfer sing "Santa Claus is Coming to Town" or Audio Adrenaline rocking out "Little Drummer Boy" that really gets things going.

## Friendly Chunk 'O Music

A year or so back I decided to take advantage of crowd sourcing and I had all my friends give me their favorite (or most eclectic) Christmas albums and I made a playlist out of them. You can listen to that here.

## Soma.FM Christmas Lounge

One of the best, pretty eclectic, and family friendly streams comes out every year thanks to Soma.FM. Check out their [Christmas Lounge station](http://somafm.com/christmas/). I'll leave this running for hours on end! P.S. It looks like they have a new [Jolly Ol Soul](http://somafm.com/jollysoul/) station that looks enticing. They also make these stations available for free on their mobile apps ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tunein.player&utm_source=somafm&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=somafmwebpromo) and [iPhone](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/somafm-holiday-radio/id579160357?mt=8)).

## 12 Songs of Christmas

This is my best of the best of the best list. Plus it matches up with the 12 days of Christmas song in a way (see what I did there? 8^D) If you don't want to go hog wild, but want a nice mix, take this one for a spin

## What's Next?

Is there something I'm missing?! Let me know! I'd love to listen to it!

Feliz Navidad! Joyeux Noel! Merry Christmas!
