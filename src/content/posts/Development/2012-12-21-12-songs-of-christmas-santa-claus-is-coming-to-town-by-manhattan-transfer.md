![The Christmas Album (The Manhattan Transfer album)](@assets/images/posts/wikipedia-en-thumb-4-4f-The_Christmas_Album.jpg-300px-The_Christmas_Album.jpg)

The first time I ever heard [Manhattan Transfer](http://www.manhattantransfer.net/ "The Manhattan Transfer") was singing this song on the TV show [Home Improvement](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101120/ "Home Improvement (TV series)"). I loved their jazz a cappella and picked up this album shortly after!
