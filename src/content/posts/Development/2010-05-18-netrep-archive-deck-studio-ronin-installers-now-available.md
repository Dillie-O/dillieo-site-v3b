A quick note for any of you still looking for Netrep/Deck Studio/RONIN details

A little while back I went ahead and took down the CCG Toolkit site, since there was no more news and updated being pushed out.

I received an e-mail _\[thanks Tyler]_ looking for the latest version of Deck Studio and I realized I didn't put the installers out on the archive page for download by anybody interested.

You can now get the Deck Studio 1.9 and RONIN 1.7.3b installers on the Netrep archive site. Just in case you're still using Deck Studio on the side or are interested in seeing how the apps run without having to compile the code. I also tossed in some Sheep and Ojama tokens I created a LONG time ago, they were rather fun.

The site for all of this is [http://ccgtoolkit.codeplex.com](http://ccgtoolkit.codeplex.com "http://ccgtoolkit.codeplex.com"). Feel free to drop me a line if you have any questions.

Enjoy all!
