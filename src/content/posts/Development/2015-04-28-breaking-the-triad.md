Well, I guess it was bound to happen, especially after I started blogging about becoming a “[default](/ack-im-becoming-a-default-user)” user.

For the past couple of year, I’ve enjoyed a “platform independence” by using a MacBook Pro laptop, Google Nexus 9 tablet, and Windows Phone 8 for my three main devices. I kind of went against my [own thoughts](http://evangelicaloutpost.com/archives/2012/08/which-walls-do-you-prefer.html) about picking a platform that works for you and sticking to it. It also allowed me dive a bit deeper into the various platforms to see their offerings and strengths.

Soon things will be a little less diverse. By the end of the week I’ll be dropping my Windows Phone for an iPhone 6.

Oddly enough, the leading reason is availability. I’m on Verizon, which has given us great service, but the number of Windows Phone devices available has dwindled to one Lumia model and an odd ball one. Both are rather old. I had scoured down a Nokia Icon through Amazon, but with the model already a year or so old, I was a little wary that it wouldn’t last 2 years. My HTC 8X is barely holding on.

The second reason, and one that has been growing, is the “handoff” integration that is available between the phone and the laptop. I do most of my work from home, and having the ability to sync up text messages/phone calls from the phone to the laptop will be a time and resource saver. I can potentially use the full laptop as a “speakerphone” for some of my conference calls. Plus moving files back and forth as needed looks to be nice. I had an iPod Touch back in the day, but it was mainly for music and a few games. This will be my first “deep dive” into the iOS environment and it’ll be interesting to see what happens.

So there ya go, life is getting a little “simpler” potentially and new tech journeys to discover. Oh, and my wife is getting a Google Nexus 6. I’m rather excited for her too 8^D
