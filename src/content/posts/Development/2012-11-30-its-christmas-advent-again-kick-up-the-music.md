It's that time again! Time to kick off the season of advent and celebrate the birth of Christ! Being the music junkie that I am, I have several places you can go (free too!) to get into that holiday spirit!

![Christmas Mix Cover](@assets/images/posts/2011-12-phatchunkochristmas.png) The first off (and my own shameless music plug) is what I like to call the "Phat Chunk 'O Christmas" this is a collection of my own holiday music I've collected over the years. There's a nice mix of instrumental, vocal, jazz, classical, and even a smidge of techno. There's about 16 hours worth of music in here, so putting it on shuffle will keep you busy. Give it a listen!

If you need a more condensed version, here's what I call my "Essential Christmas Mix", perfect for a 1 hour party or listening session.

![Christmas Lounge](@assets/images/posts/2011-12-christmaslounge.png) Finally, I've been a huge fan of [Soma.FM's Christmas Lounge](http://somafm.com/christmas) (though I thought it was better when it was named "Santa Lounge") that offeres a family friendly and very eclectic mix of Christmas music. You'll get some Bossa Nova, Big Bad Voodoo Daddy, Herb Albert, and even a little classic Charlie Brown music with some turntables mixed into the mix. You can't go wrong with the [Christmas Lounge](http://somafm.com/christmas)!

I know I'm excited to celebrate, and I need to put up my lights this weekend. I'll be posting a few of my favorite Christmas songs during the next few weeks to share. I hope you enjoy!

Oh, is there any Christmas music/stations you can pass along? Christmas music is like Christmas lights and Jell-O, there's always room for more!
