> The beat of my heart is now my song for you.

This is the line shortly into the _[Reverence](https://soundcloud.com/laladee/dj-lorraine-reverence)_ mix by DJ Lorraine (now Laladee) that has been ruminating in my mind for over a decade now...

At first it sounds like kind of a clever and catchy one liner. Those in to EDM can have a bit of a “hardcore” love of the genre and tying the beat of the music with the beat of one’s own heart is a clever play on words that goes nicely into this. But over time the lyrics have struck me as something deeper.

A song, something we sing (or sometimes shout/chant/dance), is something we give of ourselves to somebody else. It may seem small and trivial, but the investment of your time to memorize the lyrics, the exertion of our vocal chords (we won’t discuss my poor pitch at this point 8^D), and the enthusiasm and love that comes into performing that song (how many videos are out there nowadays of people singing their favorite musicians song acapella and doing crazy dances), show that the song is one of dedication and adoration. Something not to be taken lightly.

Our heart is probably the most important part of our body. Without it, we die because we have nothing to pump our life giving blood through our system. It functions innately. We don’t have to “think” about pumping blood through our system, it just happens. To that extent, it is something so simple, yet so life giving, that it has a proound effect. We start to take this metaphor when we think about what the “heart of the problem” is or when we try to work through “matters of the heart”.

> The beat of my heart is now my song for you.

Thinking about these words gives me pause and realizes there is a deep meaning to this phrase. If the most basic and life giving portion of myself, my beating heart, is to be my song for something, then my entire being, mind and soul, is given as a means of dedication and adoration to something or someone. Is there anything out there worth such a song and dedication? I wonder if in today’s world we can grasp this idea since things move so fast, items are built to be disposable, and we transition from one headline to another on a daily, if not hourly basis.

I will say for myself that my heart beats for Jesus Christ. The one who was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. The person who gave sacrificed His life for us, and conquered death, rising again. The one who offers eternal life for us by accepting His love and his gift. That is whom my heart beats for. For whom I try to make sure every beat, every thought, every deed gives dedication and adoration to Him. It should be noted that I fail miserably quite often and that there is no “pie in the sky” life that I have. God has been faithful through it all though and for that I sing for him, every moment, every beat of every day. To some I suspect it sounds scary to devote oneself to that extent, but there it is.

Do you find anything that is worthy of the beat of your heart?
