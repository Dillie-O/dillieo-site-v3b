I think most fathers have "Butterfly Kisses" or some other song as an "anthem" of sorts when relating to their daughters. It's that one song that they'll have to dance to when they get married. It'll probably be that song that'll go through their head when reminiscing on wonderful things.

For me, it's a little different. We had some Jen's friend and her husband over for dinner the other night and she had asked to hear the story of our girls. Their 3 months in the NICU, and how that went. Amidst the rush of memories that started coming back, I remember many nights during those months where I was driving out to the hospital around 9 or 10 at night to drop some stuff off and read them a story. I had recently purchased the latest Audio Adrenaline CD and this song just seemed to resonate more than the rest:

> I’m a warrior, I’m a warrior
>
> I would die for You, for You
>
> My love is fierce, I’m a warrior
>
> I would die for You, for You
>
> I’m a warrior with a warrior’s heart
>
> And it burns for You, for You
>
> My love is fierce, I’m a warrior
>
> I would die for You, give it all for You
>
> I won’t give up, I won’t give up on You
>
> I won’t give up on You
>
> I will sing Your name until my heart caves in
>
> Until my heart caves in
>
> _([Until my Heart Caves In](http://www.audioa.com/default2.aspx) - From the album of the same title.)_

Unrelenting, full of zeal, fiercely loving. Haylee, Rylee, daddy will remain that way for you until the end, until my heart caves in.
