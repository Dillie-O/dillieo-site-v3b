| *...mini thanks to fun last minute things you can do with ChatGPT* |

A lot of this year has been reflection and resetting. As I do, three things trickle up to the top that I'm thankful for, albeit there are plenty more...

## Friends

This has been the year of reunions. I've reconnected with a group of friends from high school that I spent four years learning French with. I've made sure to keep in touch with some of my friends from my previous job. Finally after about 5 years I was able to see my best friend face to face and give him a big hug. Those morning breakfasts or lunchtime hangouts were priceless. There so much to be said about a good gab fest, I highly encourage it.

## Breathing

 The speed and chaos of the month or week _(or even day)_ continues and I realized that oddly enough the biggest way to nullify the stress of this was to simply stop and breathe for a minute. A minute seems so short and yet can be so long and beneficial when you're able to stop and gain some perspective through breathing or prayer. It has become so helpful that I even made an [app to support me](https://oneminutetobreathe.com/) to do this. Sure this is a bit of a shameless plug but I truly am thankful for embracing this.

## Pokemon Go

Pokemon Go has been a source of fun and joy for our family this past year. Nearly every Friday after I wrapped up work we'd hop in the car, drive to our favorite location and go wild. Sometime this was catching, sometimes this was driving all around down to finish a special challenge, sometimes it was joining a massive raid. A lot of times it was ALL of the above. Oh yeah, then there were the weekend community days too 8^D. It was simple, cheap fun that always had something new going on.

## Et Vous?

What are you thankful for this year? It is more important than ever to find even the small things in your life and name them as we approach the grey of winter and cold it brings. There's also plenty of evidence to show how a mindset of thankfulness does wonders. [I’d like to hear them!](/contact/)
