You would think after doing a full 10 day course on improving my blogging that each week I’d be able to tackle things with gusto. The last couple of weeks, even blogging twice a week, has been kind of hard, oddly enough. Maybe I’m just over thinking things now. I do have some old posts that I started and should finish off. Maybe I’m making myself too nervous that I should see improvements or something.

Who knows.

A good friend of mine said that he remembers a great quote about how some writers work and polish and work and polish and take forever to get that first book or draft out. Others just get the first draft out there and continually polish it, having it out in front of you, a piece of you, and can work on refining yourself. I tend to be more of the former, but I like the prospect of the latter. So that’s what I’m going to work towards, with this new blogging me and all.

Yep, nothing fancy, but there it is in front of me. Time to polish.
