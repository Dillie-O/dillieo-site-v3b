My grandfather once told me there are only 4 things you truly need in life:

- Food
- Water

- Clothing

Outside of that, there isn’t much else to consider. He liked to gripe _\[in that good way]_ that people spent too much money on their gadgets and cars and trinkets, when they should be spending more on better food (of the fresh fruit and veggies kind) and making sure their rent is paid and that their clothes don’t have too many holes, fit proper, and actually keep you warm in winter.

Most else becomes tertiary. I believe there are personal and spiritual needs as well. I think we all need some time to oneself to ponder, read, pray, to enrich oneself. But unpacking that is something best left for a longer day and a clearer head.
