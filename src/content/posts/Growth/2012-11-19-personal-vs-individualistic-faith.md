...American Christianity is mired in this individualistic mindset right along with the rest of the culture. Most American Christians confuse Christianity being a personal faith with its being an individualistic faith.

While each one of us must respond personally to God’s grace, the result of that response is incorporation into Christ’s body, the Church. There, as Chuck Colson constantly reminded us, we are called to live for others and not for ourselves.
