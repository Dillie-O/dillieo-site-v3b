Today I finished another 7 mile run in my ongoing RAGNAR training for July. My body was still pretty tired from the run two days prior, so the last mile and a half, which includes a really steep hill followed by a trail climb through some switchbacks to the end was more of a survival run than a race to the finish.

My body was pretty exhausted and my legs were feeling particularly sore. However, some stretching, water, and a shower later, and my spirit was telling me, "Hey let's go do another 5 miles" and my body was telling me, "Yeah, It think we can manage that."

This is a good threshold for me. It means I'm doing some hard training, but not so much that I completely destroy my body for the rest of the day, or for the next run that comes up. I can really do some good base building and potentially a little more speed training, though I'm not looking to do that quite yet.

I'm also at a good milestone where I'm able to run the length of an average RAGNAR leg and be in a position to do the rest of them. Three legs in 24 hours is some crazy, yet fun, stuff.

The next big milestone to hit is that elusive 10 miler. I plan on getting there by July, but I need to make sure I do it without burning myself out.

Onward and upward!
