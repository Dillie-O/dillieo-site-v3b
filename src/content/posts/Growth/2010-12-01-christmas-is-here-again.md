_Note: This is a repost from back in the summer, but the Season of Advent is here, so it's worth sharing!_

_O Holy Night_ is by far my favorite Christmas carol of the season. While I'm not a collector of different versions of the song, I do tend to attune ear a bit more when I hear a new version on the radio or elsewhere.

A few years back, Jen and I were following the series '[Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studio_60_on_the_Sunset_Strip)' which was a drama style show set to follow the behind the scenes of a SNL type show. One of the episodes close to Christmas time was reflecting upon the recent Hurricane Katrina issues, they have a New Orleans Band play a song on the show. The song was _O Holy Night_, and while it wasn't my favorite rendition, it is definitely up there as my top 3.

Imagine my surprise then when at the end of the episode they displayed a brief message saying "Download this song for free on the show's website." I jumped at this immediately the next morning and have added it to my Christmas collection.

Since the song was/is free, I figured this might be a nice way to spread some holiday cheer to any of the readers out there. It is a nice mellow rendition of the song, with some good New Orleans flair (it is a brass quartet if memory serves) with a little bit of that "Studio" flair added on to the end. For those of you that want to follow along with the lyrics, here they are in full:

_O Holy Night! The stars are brightly shining, It is the night of the dear Saviour's birth. Long lay the world in sin and error pining. Till He appeared and the Spirit felt its worth. A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices, For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn. Fall on your knees! Oh, hear the angel voices! O night divine, the night when Christ was born; O night, O Holy Night , O night divine! O night, O Holy Night , O night divine!_

\_\_

_Led by the light of faith serenely beaming, With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand. O'er the world a star is sweetly gleaming, Now come the wisemen from out of the Orient land. The King of kings lay thus lowly manger; In all our trials born to be our friends. He knows our need, our weakness is no stranger, Behold your King! Before him lowly bend! Behold your King! Before him lowly bend!_

\_\_

_Truly He taught us to love one another, His law is love and His gospel is peace. Chains he shall break, for the slave is our brother. And in his name all oppression shall cease. Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we, With all our hearts we praise His holy name. Christ is the Lord! Then ever, ever praise we, His power and glory ever more proclaim! His power and glory ever more proclaim!_

Feliz Navidad! Joyeux Noël à tout le monde!! Merry Christmas Everybody!!!
