Yeah, I'll admit it. I've got kind of a thing for rock bands with female vocalists. There's something to that balance between slamming sound and soft vocals (or sometimes loud) that I really like. Ever since my all time favorite band Audio Adrenaline moved on to bigger things, I've been looking for some good bands to rock out to.

Then one day on the radio I heard Superchick and I got goosebumps all over again. Their music is rockin' and their lyrics really hit home on some hard issues without trying to be fluffy about it.

Enter the song "Stand in the Rain" from their _Beauty From Pain_ album. Listening to the song and hearing the lyrics, I don't really see it providing a solution to the troubles around you, other than to continue to hold strong, to stand in the rain, and let it work it's way through. Often times we want to fight that which we can't change, especially during the our hard times in life. Sometimes we need to just stand, not lose hope, and wait to see what happens. It's not fun, I've been there, but it gives me hope to endure.

Enjoy the lyrics and the music.

> **Stand In The Rain** She never slows down She doesn’t know why, but she knows That when she’s all alone It feels like it’s all coming down
>
> She won’t turn around The shadows are long and she fears If she cries that first tear The tears will not stop raining down
>
> _So stand in the rain \_\_Stand your ground Stand up when it’s all crashing down You stand through the pain You won’t drown And one day what’s lost can be found You stand in the rain_
>
> She won’t make a sound Alone in this fight with herself And the fear’s whispering If she stands, she’ll fall down She wants to be found The only way out is through everything She’s running from She wants to give up and lie down
