Last night I was up a litle late waiting for the update of the Tournament Card Registry to compile and an old friend from college was on Facebook and made kind of a random status posting. I had to bite at the opportunity and here's how it transpired:

(Friend) Nick is chillin' out, maxin', relaxin' all cool and I'm shootin' some b-ball outside of the school.

(Me) Sean  
Be careful! There might be a couple of guys up to no good trying to make trouble in your neighborhood...

Nick  
I know, right. I got in one little fight and my mom got scared, she said I'm moving with my auntie and uncle to Bel Air.

Sean  
So here's some advice. Whistle for a cab, and when it comes near, make sure the license plate says "FRESH" and that there are dice in the rear view mirror.

Nick  
I DID! And if anything, I can say that this cab was rare, but I thought "nah, forget it..Yo Holmes, To BEL AIR!

Sean  
So what time did you make it there?

Nick  
I. Pulled. Up to the house about 7 or 8.

Sean  
Oh wait, I remember that cabbie, he stank something nasty!

Nick  
Hellz yeah. I yelled to the cabbie "Yo Holmes, smell you later!" Then I looked at my kingdom, and I was finally there!

Sean  
Oh shaft, so YOU'RE the Prince of Bel Air!!! I never knew I was in such royalty...man the things you learn this late at night. 8^D

There were a couple interjections along the way with some confused folks. I guess we owe a great deal of thanks to Will Smith, for such randomness that comes to our minds a decade or so later. Thanks also goes to Facebook: allowing friends across states to engage in live poetry exchanges using old television show lyrics since 2004.
